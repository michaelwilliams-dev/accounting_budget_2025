Aggregates Levy will continue to apply to aggregate produced or used in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. This measure makes legislative changes to Aggregates Levy in preparation for devolution so that aggregates producers who supply taxable aggregate across the Scottish border in either direction will be responsible for paying the tax of the destination country. ## Policy objective The objective of the measure is to support the introduction of the devolved Scottish Aggregates Tax. The changes seek to minimise complexity and prevent businesses which had not previously been within scope of Aggregates Levy from becoming liable to the tax. It also makes changes to avoid double taxation on aggregate supplied cross-border by middlemen in a supply chain, such as builders' merchants, by ensuring that aggregate which has had the Scottish Aggregates Tax paid on it in Scotland will not be liable to Aggregates Levy if it is further supplied to England, Wales or Northern Ireland. ## Background to the measure The devolution of Aggregates Levy follows a recommendation in the Smith Commission report in 2014 to devolve further powers to the Scottish Parliament. The Scotland Act 2016 gave the Scottish Parliament the power to introduce a replacement tax for Aggregates Levy in Scotland, while disapplying the Levy in Scotland from a future date to be determined by the Treasury. The Scottish government and Revenue Scotland consulted on and developed a new tax to replace Aggregates Levy in Scotland. The Aggregates Tax and Devolved Taxes Administration (Scotland) Act received Royal Assent in 2024 and sets out the framework for Scottish Aggregates Tax. HMRC have worked with their counterparts in the Scottish government and Revenue Scotland to minimise additional burdens on taxpayers supplying aggregates across the border and to avoid double taxation. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date The changes will apply on and"}, {"file": "Changes to Aggregates Levy legislation in preparation for devolution to Scotland - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "after 1 April 2026. ## Current law The current law for Aggregates Levy is set out in Part 2 of the Finance Act 2001, sections 16 to 49 and schedules 4 to 10. Relevant secondary legislation is in the Aggregates Levy (General) Regulations 2002 (SI 2002/761) as amended. Section 18 of, and Schedule 1 to, the Scotland Act 2016 have made prospective changes to Part 2 of the Finance Act 2001. ## Proposed revisions From 1 April 2026, secondary legislation will bring into effect the changes made to Part 2 of the Finance Act 2001 by the Scotland Act 2016. References in the Finance Act 2001 to 'United Kingdom' will change to 'England, Wales or Northern Ireland' to disapply Aggregates Levy in Scotland. Amendments to section 30 of the Act will enable regulations to provide for a tax credit for aggregate moving to Scotland or Scottish waters from England, Wales or Northern Ireland. Finance Bill 2025-26 will introduce legislation to make the following further amendments to the Finance Act 2001 from 1 April 2026: - section 19 will be amended so that aggregate moving from a producer's site in Scotland to England, Wales or Northern Ireland will become liable to Aggregates Levy - section 17 will be amended so that aggregate which has been subject to various movements that mean Scottish Aggregates Tax will have been paid on it will not be subject to Aggregates Levy when further moved to England, Wales or Northern Ireland - section 48 will be amended to define different parts of United Kingdom waters (adjacent to Scotland or adjacent to the rest of the United Kingdom) which will be referred to in the Act - the Aggregates Levy (General) Regulations 2002 will be amended to provide for a tax credit on aggregate which is moved to Scotland or Scottish waters from England, Wales or Northern Ireland ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3 million) | 2025 to 2026 | 2026 to 2027 | 2027 to 2028 | 2028 to 2029 | 2029 to 2030 | 2030 to 2031 | |----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------| | nil | nil | nil | nil | nil | nil | This measure is not expected to have an Exchequer impact. ## Macroeconomic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. ## Impact on individuals, households and families There is no impact on individuals as this measure only affects businesses. ## Equalities impacts This measure only affects businesses, therefore it is not anticipated that there will be disproportionate impacts on those in groups sharing protected characteristics. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations This measure is expected to have a negligible impact on approximately 150 registered businesses who either extract aggregate in Scotland or supply aggregate to Scotland from England, Wales or Northern Ireland. This includes an estimated 40 businesses or fewer who supply aggregate across the Scottish border and will need to account for both taxes (paying one while claiming a tax credit for the"}, {"file": "Changes to Aggregates Levy legislation in preparation for devolution to Scotland - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "other). One-off costs include familiarisation with the new rules and registering with Revenue Scotland to pay Scottish Aggregates Tax. The Scottish government has published an impact assessment (https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottishaggregates-tax-administration-regulations-business-regulatory-impact-assessment/) of the business impacts associated with the introduction of Scottish Aggregates Tax. Businesses that no longer have a liability to Aggregates Levy will need to notify HMRC to deregister. Businesses who supply aggregates across the border may have one-off costs from updating existing software to claim a tax credit from one tax while paying the other. Continuing costs for these businesses include completing additional returns. Customer experience for businesses supplying aggregate across the border could be impacted through having to account for both Aggregates Levy and Scottish Aggregates Tax. To support these businesses HMRC and Revenue Scotland will provide clear and targeted guidance to explain the new obligations. The changes are not expected to impact civil society organisations. ## Operational impact (\u00a3 million) (HMRC or other) There are no anticipated operational impacts or associated costs for HMRC as a result of this measure. ## Other impacts Other impacts have been considered and none have been identified. ## Monitoring and evaluation The administrative changes made to Aggregates Levy as a result of devolution to Scotland will be monitored through information collected from registrations and tax returns, as well as through communication with the aggregates sector. ## Further advice If you have any questions about this change, contact Michael Lyttle by telephone ## on 03000 585637 or email michael.lyttle@hmrc.gov.uk.

The company or social enterprise might have an advance assurance (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/venture-capital-schemes-apply-for-advance-assurance) letter from HMRC that shows the company and the share issue meets the conditions for the relevant scheme. Any advance assurance given to a company is only in respect of certain conditions of the venture capital schemes being met based on the information provided by the company. It should not be read as a general endorsement by HMRC or an indication of potential investment performance. Investors should conduct their own due diligence before making an investment. You can invest directly in a qualifying company or enterprise using a venture capital scheme if you meet the conditions for investors. The company or enterprise will also need to meet the conditions for the scheme to qualify. Even though a company may have received an advance assurance letter from HMRC, the company must complete: - an online compliance statement form SEIS1 or EIS1 and submit to HMRC - the section of the form that asks to list all the investors who have asked for SEIS3, EIS3 or EIS5 certificate This form confirms the company has met all the conditions of the scheme and will continue to do so for the next 3 years. HMRC will review the compliance statement. If satisfied that the company has met the conditions of the scheme, we will issue the company form SEIS2 or EIS2 which will contain a Unique Investment Reference number for the particular share issue to the company. This authorises the company to issue specific number of compliance certificates (form SEIS3 or EIS3) only to those investors listed in the compliance statement. The SEIS3 or EIS3 is provided in PDF by HMRC along with the SEIS2 or EIS2.

It is important to note that when you receive SEIS3 or EIS3 this only indicates that HMRC is satisfied that the company has met the scheme requirements. In order to be eligible for tax relief you must also meet the investor conditions - read Venture Capital Schemes Manual VCM14150 (https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/venturecapital-schemes-manual/vcm14150) for more information. If you have invested through an 'EIS knowledge-intensive approved investment fund' as a nominee, then the fund manager will receive compliance certificates (EIS3s) issued to them by the company or companies concerned. The manager will send you form EIS5 to submit, to make a claim for relief. Form EIS5 can include investment made in several qualifying EIS knowledge-intensive companies. You can also invest in shares in a Venture Capital Trust. A Venture Capital Trust is a company (like an investment trust) that's been approved by HMRC and invests in, or lends money to, unlisted companies. You can invest in a Venture Capital Trust if you're over 18 years old. The Venture Capital Trust will use your money to invest in qualifying companies. ## Tax reliefs you can claim Depending on the scheme, you may be able to claim: - Income Tax relief against your investment in qualifying companies, enterprises or Venture Capital Trusts - Income Tax relief against a loan or 'debt instrument' to a social enterprise - Capital Gains Tax relief on any gains you make on your investment - Capital Gains Tax relief when you reinvest a previous gain in a scheme ## Income Tax relief You can get relief by investing in newly issued shares or by loaning money to a social enterprise (through a debt instrument) for Social Investment Tax Relief for investments made on or before 5 April 2023.

This publication is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/corporation-taxincreases-to-late-filing-penalties/increases-to-corporation-tax-late-filing-penalties ## Who is likely to be affected Companies who do not file returns at the required time for Corporation Tax (CT) will incur higher penalty charges. ## General description of the measure The government will increase the level of fixed late filing penalties for CT. ## Policy objective The objective of the measure is to encourage companies to file their CT returns on time. Filing penalties for CT returns were set in 1998. The relative value of these penalties, and therefore behavioural impact, has been eroded by nearly 30 years of inflation and in real terms they are worth around half the amount they were when introduced. The penalties are therefore being increased to restore their original real terms value. ## Background to the measure The measure was announced at Budget 2025. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date This measure will have effect for returns for which the filing date is on or after 1 April 2026. ## Current law and Proposed revisions The tables below list the penalties, current amounts and the increase. ## Company Tax Returns: Schedule 18 Finance Act 1998 | Legislation | Current rate | New Rate | |--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------| | Return late | \u00a3100 | \u00a3200 | | Return is more than 3 months late | \u00a3200 | \u00a3400 | | Three successive failures, return late | \u00a3500 | \u00a31000 | | Three successive failures, return is more than 3 months late | \u00a31000 | \u00a32000 | ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3 million) | 2025 to | 2026 to | 2027 to | 2028 to | 2029 to | 2030 to | |-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 | 2031 | 0 +45 +60 +65 +65 +70 These figures are set out in Table 4.1 of Budget 2025 and have been certified by the Office for Budget Responsibility. More details can be found in the policy costings document published alongside Budget 2025. ## Macroeconomic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. ## Impact on individuals, households and families There is no impact on individuals as this measure only affects incorporated businesses. ## Equalities impacts This measure"}, {"file": "Increases to Corporation Tax late filing penalties - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "only affects businesses, therefore it is not anticipated that there will be disproportionate impacts on those in groups sharing protected characteristics. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations This measure will have no impact on those compliant businesses and civil society organisations who file their returns on time. Non-compliant businesses and civil society organisations will see an increase in the penalties for late filing. ## Operational impact (\u00a3 million) There is no significant IT change for this measure. As a result, any IT cost would be negligible. ## Other impacts Other impacts have been considered, but none have been identified. ## Monitoring and evaluation This measure will be monitored through information collected from tax returns and compliance activity alongside other measures in the government's package for closing the tax gap. ## Further advice If you have any questions about this change, contact Paul Younger at email paul.younger2@hmrc.gov.uk.

Current law provides for the repayment of tax and interest amounts collected under Schedule 7ZA, but only provides for interest to be applied to repayments of tax. ## Policy objective This measure operates alongside The Controlled Foreign Companies (Reversal of State Aid Recovery) Regulations 2024 so that companies affected by the 2019 EU State Aid Decision on the Controlled Foreign Companies rules are put into the position they would have been in had that decision not been made and no recovery of alleged State aid had taken place. ## Background to the measure This measure was announced at Budget 2025. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date The measure will take effect from 2 December 2025. ## Current law The Controlled Foreign Companies regime is set out in Part 9A Taxation (International and other Provisions) Act 2010 (TIOPA 2010). TIOPA 2010 is treated, by virtue of paragraph (b) of Schedule 4 to the Taxation (Post-transition Period) Act 2020, as having a Schedule 7ZA. Schedule 7ZA provides for the recovery of amounts in relation to the 2019 European Commission State aid Decision on the Controlled Foreign Companies rules. The Controlled Foreign Companies (Reversal of State Aid Recovery) Regulations 2024 provide for the amounts recovered under Schedule 7ZA to be repaid. Section 826 Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 provides for the interest to be applied to amounts of tax repaid under the regulations. ## Proposed revisions Legislation will be introduced in Finance Bill 2025-26, applicable from 2 December 2025, to provide for repayment interest to be paid in respect of amounts of interest that were recovered under paragraph 7 of Schedule 7ZA and are subsequently repaid. The measure"}, {"file": "Controlled foreign companies \u2014 treatment of interest on the reversal of state aid recovery - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "applies in relation to repayments of interest made to companies as a result of the cancellation of an interest charging notice given under Schedule 7ZA. The interest payable is the amount that would have been payable under section 826 Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (interest on tax overpaid) if the relevant repayment had been within the scope of those repayment interest provisions. This measure applies to Schedule 7ZA interest only, and does not alter the general position that repayment interest is only paid in respect of repayments of tax. ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3 million) | 2025 to 2026 | 2026 to 2027 | 2027 to 2028 | 2028 to 2029 | 2029 to 2030 | 2030 to 2031 | |----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------| | negligible | negligible | negligible | negligible | negligible | negligible | This measure is expected to have a negligible impact on the Exchequer. ## Macroeconomic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. ## Impact on individuals, households and families There is no impact on individuals as this measure only affects businesses. ## Equalities impacts This measure only affects businesses; therefore, it is not anticipated that there will be disproportionate impacts on groups sharing protected characteristics. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations This measure is expected to have a negligible impact on multinational businesses which had amounts of interest recovered from them by HMRC under paragraph 7 of Schedule 7ZA TIOPA 2010, and who will now be eligible for repayment interest in relation to amounts of interest repaid pursuant to The Controlled Foreign Companies (Reversal of State Aid Recovery) Regulations 2024. One-off costs will include familiarisation with this change and confirming payment details to HMRC. There are not expected to be any continuing costs. This measure is not expected to impact on businesses experience of dealing with HMRC as it does not change any processes or tax admin obligations. There are not expected to be any impacts on civil society organisations. ## Operational impact (\u00a3 million) (HMRC or other) The measure will have a negligible operational impact on HMRC. ## Other impacts Other impacts have been considered and none have been identified. ## Monitoring and evaluation The measure will be kept under review through communications with affected taxpayer groups. ## Further advice If you have any questions about this change, email mailboxcfcs@hmrc.gov.uk.

From: Published HM Treasury , The Rt Hon Rachel Reeves MP and The Rt Hon Wes Streeting MP 21 November 2025 - Rachel Reeves announces cost of a single prescription will remain at \u00a39.90, as she takes firm action to tackle the cost of living ahead of next week's Budget - The move is further evidence of the government's commitment to keep bills down for working people and ensure all patients can receive the treatment they need. The Chancellor has announced that NHS prescription charges will remain frozen next year, which will help millions of hard-working people with the cost of living and ensure patients have access to the care they need. Ahead of next week's Budget, Rachel Reeves confirmed that the cost of a single prescription will be frozen at \u00a39.90 - saving patients around \u00a312 million next year. This will not only continue to support patients with the cost of living but also help ensure that no patient places themselves at risk by not taking their medication due to the cost of picking it up. It comes as the Chancellor sets out the fair choices she will take at the Budget to deliver on the public's priorities to cut NHS waiting lists, cut national debt and cut the cost of living. ## Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves said: - No one should put their health at risk because they can't a ff ord their medication, and as the cost of living still puts pressure on households I'm extending the cash freeze on prescription charges. ' - Since taking o ffi ce, we've been committed to fixing the NHS, and waiting lists are down by 230,000 over the past year. At next week's Budget I will take the fair choices to deliver what matters most to the ' country: cutting waiting lists, cutting the cost of living and cutting the national debt.' At last year's Budget, the Chancellor took action to freeze NHS prescription charges for the first time in three years and in her e ff orts to ease the cost of living, this year the Chancellor has decided to extend the freeze over the next year. Around 89% of prescriptions in England are already dispensed free of charge to children, over-60s, pregnant women, and those with certain medical conditions. Three month and annual prescriptions prepayment certificates will also be frozen for 2026/27 keeping costs low for those with a regular need for prescriptions. In addition to the freeze on charges, the NHS Low Income Scheme o ff ers help with prescription payments, with free prescriptions for eligible people in certain groups such as pensioners, students, and those who receive state benefits or live in care homes.

This will: - include any other de minimis state aid received in the 3 years, up to and including the date of the investment - count towards any limits for later investments through other venture capital schemes (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/venture-capital-schemes-raise-money-by-offeringtax-reliefs-to-investors) There are various rules you must follow so your investors can claim and keep the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme tax reliefs relating to their shares.

Your company's trade must be treated as a commercial business with the aim of making profits. However, your trade will not qualify if it consists mostly of an excluded activity. ## Meeting the risk to capital condition The investment in your company must meet the risk to capital condition. This means: - your company must have the intention to grow and develop its trade over the long term - for example, you'll use the investment to grow things like your revenue, customer base and number of employees - the investment should be a risk to the investors' capital The growth and development of your company should be permanent and not rely on the investor's continued support. The investment should carry a risk that the investor will lose more capital than they are likely to gain as a net return. HMRC will not consider the maximum return an investor could get if your company is successful, because this cannot be guaranteed. The net return includes: - income from dividends, interest payments and other fees - capital growth - upfront tax relief When deciding if you meet the risk to capital condition, we will look at things like your company's: - sources of income - assets - structure - use of subcontractors - marketing of the investment opportunity - relationship with other companies You will not meet the risk to capital condition if there are risk reducing arrangements in place that result in an investor: - getting priority over other investors - being able to withdraw their money as soon as possible - protecting their money so that other investors money is used first ## Issuing shares You can ask HMRC if your share issue is likely to qualify before you go ahead, this is called advance assurance (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/venture-capitalschemes-apply-for-advance-assurance). The shares you issue must be paid up in full, in cash, when they're issued. Your company should have a way to accept payment before shares are issued. To qualify for the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme the shares issued must be full risk ordinary shares which: - are not redeemable - carry no special rights to your assets The shares you issue can have limited preferential rights to dividends.

This publication is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cryptoasset-reportingframework-reporting-of-uk-resident-cryptoasset-users/domestic-reporting-of-uk-resident-cryptoassetusers-under-the-cryptoasset-reporting-framework ## Who is likely to be affected Reporting cryptoasset service providers (RCASPs). ## General description of the measure The Cryptoasset Reporting Framework (CARF) enables cross-border information exchanges between tax authorities on the transactions of users of cryptoassets. Cryptoassets are a rapidly expanding and globally developing area. Tax authorities need to have comprehensive information on cryptoassets. The UK is implementing the CARF for first international data exchanges in 2027. The CARF requires UK RCASPs to collect tax relevant information and undertake due diligence in relation to their users on an annual basis. The CARF rules and commentary (as developed at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and incorporated into UK law) do not currently oblige UK RCASPs to collect information on cryptoasset activity undertaken by UK resident customers. This measure will require UK RCASPs to also collect information concerning UK resident customers. This means HMRC will have CARF data on all UK taxpayers using a UK based RCASP together with information concerning UK taxpayers from overseas RCASPs through the exchange of information. ## Policy objective The CARF was implemented to support the successful Common Reporting Standard (CRS) which allows tax authorities to exchange information about financial accounts. The use of cryptoassets had the potential to erode the success of the CRS, as the CRS does not require the reporting of cryptoasset transactions. By implementing the CARF, participating jurisdictions aim to increase data transparency and support tax compliance internationally. This measure ensures that HMRC will have CARF data on all UK taxpayers using both UK based and non-UK based RCASPs. HMRC will receive this standardised, structured data which is required on an annual basis. HMRC could use existing information powers to request information regarding UK tax residents. However, this measure aims to streamline reporting obligations for RCASPs who will be reporting through the CARF and provide HMRC with tax relevant data to further compliance activities. This data will be used to tackle tax evasion, avoidance and help UK taxpayers to meet their tax obligations. ## Background to the measure Following international consultation in 2022, on 8 June 2023 the OECD issued a publication entitled 'International Standards for Automatic Exchange of"}, {"file": "Domestic reporting of UK resident cryptoasset users under the Cryptoasset Reporting Framework - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "Information in Tax Matters: Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework and 2023 update to the Common Reporting Standard'. The UK was involved throughout the discussion and agreement of these model rules at the OECD. A consultation on UK implementation of the CARF was concluded on 29 May 2024. In this consultation the government proposed the option of including UK residents who were customers of UK RCASPs as part of the data collected under the CARF. This proposal was positively received, and the government announced this additional reporting of UK resident customers in the Autumn Budget 2024. Secondary legislation was introduced on 25 June 2025, and these regulations will come into force on 1 January 2026. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date The measure will have effect on and after the date of Royal Assent to Finance Bill 2025-26. ## Current law The current law is included in The Reporting Cryptoasset Service Providers (Due Diligence and Reporting Requirements) Regulations 2025 (SI 2025/744). ## Proposed revisions Primary legislation will be included in Finance Bill 2025-26 to amend the duty under regulation 6 of 'The Reporting Cryptoasset Service Providers (Due Diligence and Reporting Requirements) Regulations 2025 (S.I. 2025/744)' to also include cryptoasset users who are resident in the UK or have controlling persons who are resident in the UK. The legislation also provides a power for HM Treasury to maintain this legislation. ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3 million) | 2025 to 2026 | 2026 to 2027 | 2027 to 2028 | 2028 to 2029 | 2029 to 2030 | 2030 to 2031 | |----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------| | - | negligible | negligible | negligible | negligible | negligible | This measure is expected to have negligible impact on the Exchequer. ## Macroeconomic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. ## Impact on individuals, households and families This measure will have an impact on individuals who run a cryptoasset service provider business by requiring them to report information on UK resident cryptoasset users. At present we are not aware of any cryptoasset businesses that operate through individuals. This measure requires reporting of transactions of individual cryptoasset users. This reporting requirement is for the RCASPs and not the individual cryptoasset user. The measure is not expected to impact on family formation, stability, or breakdown. This measure is expected overall to have no impact on individuals' experience of dealing with HMRC as the measure doesn't change tax obligations. ## Equalities impacts An individual may be affected by this measure regardless of their protected characteristics. If a protected group is overrepresented in this population, then it will be disproportionately impacted. Cryptoasset service providers are mostly corporate businesses and therefore it is not anticipated that there will be disproportionate impacts on those in groups sharing protected characteristics for this population. For individuals who hold cryptoassets, research commissioned by HMRC has shown that those in younger age groups, particularly 16 to 44, are estimated to be overrepresented in the cryptoasset owner population (76%) compared to the"}, {"file": "Domestic reporting of UK resident cryptoasset users under the Cryptoasset Reporting Framework - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "UK adult population (46%). Males are also estimated to be overrepresented in the cryptoasset population (69%), as well as those from an Asian or Asian British ethnic background (11%), when compared to the UK adult population (51% and 5% respectively). HMRC does not currently hold data on other protected characteristics of individuals impacted by this measure and so cannot make an assessment of the impacts on those with shared protected characteristics. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations This measure will have a negligible impact on an estimated 50 businesses by requiring them to provide information on transactions for users of cryptoassets based inside the UK. Businesses will need to familiarise themselves with the change and might need to update software to include transaction data on UK customers. Ongoing costs would include recording more information and providing HMRC with more data. The impact is negligible because they already will have spent the majority of IT costs preparing for the CARF and increasing this information for users of cryptoassets resident in the UK will be a relatively small additional cost to business. This measure is not expected to disproportionately impact civil society organisation. This measure is expected overall to have an impact on business experience of dealing with HMRC. This measure includes the requirement to include UK resident customers for reporting under the CARF where previously the reporting was required only for cryptoasset users based outside the UK. ## Operational impact (\u00a3 million) (HMRC or other) This measure will have negligible operational impact on HMRC. The IT and implementation costs have already been estimated in the CARF and the extension of reporting of the CARF to UK resident cryptoasset users has already been factored into these costs. ## Other impacts Other impacts have been considered, and none have been identified. ## Monitoring and evaluation Consideration will be given to monitoring this measure through information collected from tax returns and compliance teams and kept under review by reviewing the accuracy of the tax returns and noting improvements in customer compliance. ## Further advice If you have any questions about this change, contact John Sandeman on telephone: 03000 589486 or email: eoi.policy@hmrc.gov.uk.

This publication is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reserved-investorfund/introduction-of-tax-rules-for-the-reserved-investor-fund ## Who is likely to be affected Investment fund management businesses who may wish to establish a Reserved Investor Fund (RIF), as well as the investment funds, institutions, individuals and other entities that may invest in a RIF. ## General description of the measure This measure introduces tax rules for a new type of investment fund for professional and institutional investors. ## Policy objective The RIF is designed to complement and enhance the UK's existing funds regime by meeting industry demand for a UK-based unauthorised contractual scheme with lower costs and more flexibility than the existing authorised contractual scheme. The RIF will be open to professional and institutional investors. It is expected to be particularly attractive for investment in commercial real estate. ## Background to the measure At Spring Budget 2020, the government launched a review of the UK funds regime. This review has an overarching objective to identify options which will make the UK a more attractive location to set up, manage and administer funds, and which will support a wider range of more efficient investments that are better suited to investors' needs. On 10 February 2022, the government responded to a 'call for input' carried out as part of the review. In the government's response, it committed to undertaking further work to explore options for the introduction of a new fund structure: an unauthorised contractual scheme. Industry representations suggested that a new unauthorised contractual scheme be known as a Reserved Investor Fund. The government published a consultation on the scope and design of a tax regime for a RIF on 27 April 2023, as part of Tax Administration and Maintenance Day, and responded to that consultation at Spring Budget 2024. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date This measure will take effect from a date to be determined in a statutory instrument to be laid at a later date. ## Current law Existing provisions modified by this measure are: - chapters 3 and 4 of Part 3 Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (TCGA), which contain provisions for the treatment of investment funds and their investors - schedule 5AAA of TCGA, which contains provisions for capital gains made by non- UK"}, {"file": "Introduction of tax rules for the Reserved Investor Fund - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "residents in relation to collective investment vehicles holding UK property - chapter 3 of Part 6 of TCGA, which contains provisions for insurance companies - sections 262AA to 262AF and 270IC to 270IF of Capital Allowances Act 2001 (CAA), which provide for simplified administration of capital allowances for Coownership Authorised Contractual Schemes (CoACS) - section 520 of Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005 (ITTOIA), which makes provision about personal portfolio bonds - sections 41 and 42 of Finance Act (No2) 2017 (F(2)A 2017), which provide for HM Treasury to make regulations with respect to information requirements and investments in offshore funds for CoACS - part 4 of Finance Act 2003 (FA 2003), which contains the rules for Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT), which only applies to land transactions in England and Northern Ireland - section 90 of Finance Act 1986 (FA 1986), which contains rules for SDRT - paragraph 25A of Schedule 13 to Finance Act 1999 (FA 1999), which contains rules for Stamp Duty - sections 528 and 535A of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (CTA 2010), which set out provisions for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) ## Proposed revisions Legislation will be introduced in Spring Finance Bill 2024, with detailed rules being set out in a statutory instrument to be laid at a later date. The Finance Bill clause will define what a RIF is and provide for a power for HM Treasury to make regulations in respect of RIFs. The statutory instrument will: - set out qualifying criteria for RIFs, including entry and exit provisions (and, where relevant, notification requirements) - set out provisions for breaches and mitigations, where a RIF fails to meet the qualifying criteria - set out how gains on a deemed disposal and reacquisition of investors' units will be treated - for capital gains purposes: - amend the rules in section 99A TCGA to include the RIF within the definition of umbrella schemes - insert section 103CA TCGA which provides that all co-ownership schemes are treated as a partnership, except for CoACS and RIFs - it also provides for a deemed disposal when the tax treatment of the contractual scheme changes - amend section 103D TCGA to extend the current treatment of tax transparent funds to RIFs, where certain conditions are met - amend the rules in sections 103E to K TCGA to include the RIF, so that it can access the provisions for exchanges, mergers and reorganisations - add the RIF to section 211(B) TCGA so that insurance companies can invest in RIFs subject to provisions equivalent to those already in place for insurance companies investing in certain other types of investment fund - amend Schedule 5AAA of TCGA so that a RIF is treated in the same way as a CoACS in respect of non-UK residents' capital gains, including being able to make an exemption election - amend sections 262AA to 262AF and 270IC to 270IF of CAA to extend simplified administration of capital allowances provisions to RIFs -"}, {"file": "Introduction of tax rules for the Reserved Investor Fund - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "add the RIF to the list of permitted property categories in section 520 ITTOIA 2005 to allow individual policyholders to select RIFs within their life insurance policy without the policy being classified as a personal portfolio bond - amend sections 41 and 42 of F(2)A 2017 to also permit HM Treasury to make regulations in respect of information reporting and investments in offshore funds for RIFs - For SDLT purposes: - amend the rules in section 102A FA 2003 to treat RIFs as companies in most instances - amend Part 2 Schedule 7A FA 2003 to allow RIFs to claim seeding relief - amend the rules in section 90 of FA 1986 to extend the current SDRT treatment for authorised contractual schemes to RIFs - amend the rules in paragraph 25A of Schedule 13 to FA 1999 to extend the current Stamp Duty treatment for authorised contractual schemes to RIFs - amend the rules for REITs to: - add the RIF to the list of institutional investors in section 528(4A) CTA 2010 - add disposals of units in a UK property rich RIF to the exemption in section 535A CTA 2010 ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3million) | 2023 to 2024 | 2024 to 2025 | 2025 to 2026 | 2026 to 2027 | 2027 to 2028 | 2028 to 2029 | |----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------| | - | negligible | negligible | negligible | -5 | -5 | These figures are set out in Table 5.1 of Spring Budget 2024 and have been certified by the Office for Budget Responsibility. More details can be found in the policy costings document published alongside Spring Budget 2024. ## Economic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. ## Impact on individuals, households and families This measure will impact those individuals who are able to invest in a RIF and choose to do so. The tax rules applying to the RIF will determine the income and gains they are treated as receiving from the RIF for UK tax purposes. Such individuals will be subject to the normal tax reporting obligations in respect of income and gains but otherwise will not be subject to any additional requirements by this measure. The measure is not expected to impact on family formation, stability or breakdown. Customer experience for individuals who invest in a RIF is expected to remain broadly the same as this measure does not significantly alter how they would be required to interact with HMRC. ## Equalities impacts It is not anticipated that there will be impacts for those in groups sharing protected characteristics. ## Impact on business including civil society organisations This measure will have a negligible impact on the managers of an estimated 250 funds who may wish to use the regime. One-off costs will include familiarisation with the new regime. Continuing costs could include providing HMRC with information, including an annual report, should a fund choose to enter the regime. There are not expected to be any"}, {"file": "Introduction of tax rules for the Reserved Investor Fund - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "further one-off or continuing costs. Customer experience for managers of funds which enter the RIF regime is expected to be broadly comparable to the customer experience of managers of other UK fund vehicles, such as CoACS. Guidance will be prepared to aid customers' interaction with HMRC and help them understand the requirements placed upon them if they choose to notify into the regime. The measure will also impact businesses which are able to invest in a RIF and choose to do so. The tax rules applying to the RIF will determine the income and gains such businesses are treated as receiving from the RIF for UK tax purposes. Such businesses may incur one-off costs relating to familiarisation with the new regime. No other one-off costs or continuing costs are expected. Overall, customer experience for businesses who invest in a RIF is expected to remain broadly the same as this measure does not significantly alter how they would be required to interact with HMRC. The measure is not expected to have an impact on civil society organisations. ## Operational impact (\u00a3million) (HMRC or other) This change will result in operational impacts for HMRC that are estimated to cost in the region of \u00a31.9 million. ## Other impacts Other impacts have been considered and none have been identified. ## Monitoring and evaluation The measure will be kept under review through ongoing communication with affected taxpayer groups and the collection of information through information reports and, where relevant, tax returns submitted to HMRC. ## Further advice If you have any questions about this change, contact the Financial Services Policy Team at financialservicesbai@hmrc.gov.uk.

From: Published 3 September 2025 Last updated HM Treasury 4 September 2025 - See all updates In a video message posted this morning, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves said: - Britain's economy isn't broken. But I know it's not working well enough for working people. ' - Bills are high. Getting ahead feels tougher. You put more in, get less out. That has to change. ' - We've got huge potential - world-leading brands, dynamic industries, brilliant universities, and a skilled workforce. We're a global hub for trade. ' - 'Fixing the foundations has been my mission this past year. - 'We raised the minimum wage for three million people. - 'Cut NHS waiting lists. - 'Started tearing up planning rules to build 1.5 million new homes. - 'Promised billions more for the country's infrastructure. - 'Secured trade deals with the US, India, and the EU. - And changed Treasury rules so investment reaches every part of the country. ' - 'But I'm not satisfied. There's more to do. - 'Cost of living pressures are still real. - And we must bring inflation and borrowing costs down by keeping a tight grip on day to day spending through our non-negotiable fiscal rules. ' - It's only by doing this can we a ff ord to do the things we want to do. ' - If renewal is our mission and growth are our challenge. Investment and reform are our tools.

' - 'Those are my priorities. - 'The priorities of the British people. - 'And it is what I am determined to deliver.' ## More information - Watch the Chancellor's announcement video. - The Chancellor's first job was to fix the foundations. That has meant backing working people with a National Living Wage rise benefiting three million workers, strengthening public services by starting to bring down NHS waiting lists, and unlocking growth through planning reform and an additional \u00a3120 billion investment in Britain's infrastructure. At the same time, the Government has secured Britain's place in the world with new trade deals with the US, India and the EU. - Our stewardship of the economy has also helped the Bank of England cut interest rates five times, which means lower mortgage payments and cheaper borrowing for families and businesses. With the foundations repaired and stability restored, the next Budget will turn to the long-term reforms Britain needs to unlock growth and ensure it works for working people. - HM Treasury has launched the Budget representation portal where you can submit comments on existing policy for consideration in the Budget.

This publication is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/capital-gains-taxemployee-ownership-trusts/capital-gains-tax-employee-ownership-trusts-relief-reduction ## Who is likely to be affected Individuals and trustees who dispose of shares to the trustees of an Employee Ownership Trust. ## General description of the measure This measure restricts the amount of relief from Capital Gains Tax (CGT) available on qualifying disposals of shares made to the trustees of an Employee Ownership Trust on or after 26 November 2025. From 26 November 2025, 50% of the gain on disposal to the trustees of an Employee Ownership Trust will be treated as the disposer's chargeable gain for CGT purposes. The remaining 50% of the gain will not be chargeable at the time of disposal but will continue to be held over to come into charge on any future disposal of the shares by the trustees of the Employee Ownership Trust. ## Policy objective The overall policy objective of the Employee Ownership Trust tax regime is to incentivise and support employee ownership as a viable and sustainable business model. Employee ownership gives employees a greater stake in the business in which they work, improving working conditions and driving productivity and growth in the economy. This measure promotes fairness by ensuring that those who dispose of valuable shareholdings to the trustees of an Employee Ownership Trust pay some tax on their gains, whilst retaining a significant incentive to transition companies to employee ownership by charging a lower effective rate of tax on such disposals as compared to other disposal routes. This measure supports the public finances by ensuring that the relief, which now costs significantly more than anticipated when introduced in 2014, continues to be effective whilst representing good value for money. ## Background to the measure This measure was announced at Budget 2025. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date This measure will have effect for disposals made to the trustees of an Employee Ownership Trust on or after 26 November 2025. ## Current law The main Employee Ownership Trust CGT provisions are set out at sections 236H to 236U of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act (TCGA) 1992. ## Proposed revisions Legislation will be introduced in Finance Bill 2025-26 to restrict the availability of relief on disposal of shareholdings to the trustees"}, {"file": "Capital Gains Tax \u2014 Employee Ownership Trusts relief reduction - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "of an Employee Ownership Trust from 26 November 2025. Section 236H of TGCA 1992 will be amended to provide that where the conditions for relief on disposal of shares to the trustees of an Employee Ownership Trust are met and claim is made under that section, 50% of the gain on disposal will be treated as the disposer's chargeable gain for CGT purposes. Business Asset Disposal Relief and Investors' Relief will not be available on disposals where relief under section 236H has been claimed. The remaining 50% of the gain on disposal will not form part of the disposer's chargeable gain. Instead, 50% of the gain will be held over and deducted from the trustees' acquisition cost, so that it will come into charge on any subsequent disposal or deemed disposal of the shares by the trustees. ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3 million) | 2025 to 2026 | 2026 to 2027 | 2027 to 2028 | 2028 to 2029 | 2029 to 2030 | 2030 to 2031 | |----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------| | 0 | +185 | +775 | +825 | +905 | +985 | These figures are set out in table 4.1 of Budget 2025 and have been certified by the Office for Budget Responsibility. More details can be found in the policy costings document published alongside Budget 2025. ## Macroeconomic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. ## Impact on individuals, households and families This measure will impact individuals and trustees who dispose of shares to the trustees of an Employee Ownership Trust, as the amount of relief from CGT available on these disposals will be reduced. The measure is not expected to impact on family formation, stability or ## breakdown. Customer experience is expected to stay broadly the same because this measure does not bring new taxpayers into the tax system and does not significantly change processes for existing taxpayers. ## Equalities impacts This measure will impact individuals and trustees who dispose of shares to the trustees of an Employee Ownership Trust. An individual may be affected by this measure regardless of their protected characteristics. HMRC does not currently hold data on the protected characteristics of individuals impacted by this measure and so cannot make an assessment of the impacts on those with shared protected characteristics. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations This measure is expected to have no impact on businesses as it only affects individuals and trustees who pay CGT in their personal capacity. Customer experience is expected to remain broadly the same as it does not affect how businesses will interact with HMRC. The measure is not expected to impact civil society organisations. ## Operational impact (\u00a3 million) (HMRC or other) Delivery costs to HMRC associated with this measure are expected to be \u00a33.7 million for the necessary changes to Income Tax Self Assessment and associated systems.

This clause and Schedule make amendments to the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) rules. The changes include amendment of the condition that a REIT is not a close company to ensure the rule works as intended. Further changes also allow insurance companies to hold group REITs and make technical changes to the profit: financing cost ratio, the interaction with the corporate interest restriction, the rule allowing a REIT to hold a single property and the exemption for gains on disposal of UK property rich entities. ## Details of the clause 2.

Paragraph 2 amends section 528, introducing a requirement that certain institutional investors must meet a general diversity of ownership condition or the non-close condition. 5. Subparagraph (2) of paragraph 2 introduces a new 'non-close condition'. This amendment is treated as having always had effect. 6. Subparagraph (4) of paragraph 2 introduces new subsection 528(4C) which defines the 'non-close condition'. This amendment is treated as having always had effect. 7. Subparagraph (6) of paragraph 2 introduces new subsections 528(5A) and (5B) which define a direct and indirect participator for the non-close condition.

Subparagraph (5) of paragraph 4 removes potential double taxation by excluding from the calculation of property finance costs amounts that would not be allowed in calculating profits in accordance with section 599, except for amounts disallowed under the corporate interest restriction rules. 13. Paragraph 5 amends section 529(2B) so that where a REIT meets the property rental business condition by relying on condition C and then seeks to rely on condition C in relation to a different property, the relevant time for the purposes of valuing the second property is linked to the date of sale of the first property. These amendments have effect from the date of Royal Assent of the Finance Bill. 14. Paragraph 6 amends section 535A so that a reference to the disposal of a right or interest in a company that is UK property rich includes disposal of a right or interest in a co-ownership authorised contractual scheme. This amendment has effect from the date of Royal Assent of the Finance Bill. 15. Paragraph 7 amends section 452 of TIOPA 2010 to ensure the corporate interest restriction calculation correctly takes into account the exempt gains on disposals of rights or interests in companies that are UK property rich by deeming the exemption in section 535A(2) to not apply. These amendments have effect from the date of Royal Assent of the Finance Bill. ## Background note 16. A REIT is a company through which investors can invest in real estate indirectly. Specific tax rules for UK REITs were introduced in Finance Act 2006. The regime has proved popular and the number of UK REITs stands at 127 as of June 2023. 17. Subject to meeting the relevant conditions, a company may notify HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) that it is to be treated as a UK REIT. Its property rental profits and gains are then, in broad terms, treated as exempt from corporation tax, subject to ongoing conditions such as a requirement to distribute 90% of its exempt profits as property income distributions, which are in turn treated as property rental income in investors' hands. 18. A 'Review of the UK funds regime: a call for input' was published on 26 January 2021 with a summary of responses issued on 10 February 2022. As part of this wider review of the UK funds regime, the government considered proposals for further changes to the REIT regime to reduce unnecessary burdens and make the regime more attractive for investment in the UK. Some of these changes were made in Finance Act 2022 and Finance Act 2023. This Schedule brings forward a further tranche of changes. 19.

This publication is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/changes-to-employeecar-ownership-schemes-for-income-tax/changes-to-employee-car-ownership-schemes-ecos ## Who is likely to be affected Businesses and employers that provide vehicles through Employee Car Ownership Schemes (ECOS), and their employees that are provided with vehicles through these arrangements. ## General description of the measure This measure amends the benefit in kind rules so that vehicles provided through ECOS arrangements will be deemed as taxable benefits when made available on restricted terms, outlined in the legislation. Arrangements existing prior to commencement will continue without a change in treatment until the earlier of the arrangement being varied, renewed, or 6 April 2032. The measure also provides an exemption from the benefit in kind rules for vehicles provided on arm's length terms within the motor industry. ## Policy objective Private use of a company car is a valuable benefit, and it is right the appropriate tax is paid on it. This measure will ensure fairness with other taxpayers, reduce distortions in the tax system, and it reinforces the emissions-based company car tax regime which incentivises the take-up of zero emission vehicles. To support the automotive industry and provide employers more time to adjust to the changes, the government has delayed implementation of the measure to 6 April 2030 and introduced transitional rules. ## Background to the measure This measure was announced at Autumn Budget 2024. A draft copy of the legislation for technical consultation was published on 21 July 2025 as part of Legislation Day. The measure announced at Autumn Budget 2024 with an operative date of 6 April 2026. As part of the publication of draft legislation on 21 July, the government announced its intention to delay this to 6 October 2026. The government is now confirming its intention to further delay the operative date to 6 April 2030. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date The measure will take effect from 6 April 2030. ## Current law Current law is included in Chapter 6 Part 3 of the Income Tax (Earnings &amp; Pensions) Act (ITEPA) 2003. ## Proposed revisions Legislation will be introduced make the following changes. Sections 114 to 118 ITEPA set out when a car or van is made available for private use and a benefit charge may arise. Section 114"}, {"file": "Changes to Employee Car Ownership Schemes (ECOS) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "and section 116 will be amended to deem vehicles provided through qualifying arrangements as subject to chapter 6, they are classified as made available for private use and a benefit charge applies. Section 116A will be inserted into chapter 6. It sets out that qualifying arrangements mean the transfer of the ownership of the vehicle to the employee where one or more of the following criteria are met: - where there are restrictions on the employee's private use of the vehicle - where the employee is not the registered keeper of the vehicles - where, as part of the arrangement, there is a set buyback or onward sale arrangement Subsection 117(4) will be inserted into chapter 6. It sets out an exception from chapter 6 for cars or vans made available on arm's length terms within the motor industry. ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3 million) | 2025 to 2026 | 2026 to 2027 | 2027 to 2028 | 2028 to 2029 | 2029 to 2030 | 2030 to 2031 | |----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------| | - | - | - | - | - | +15 | This measure combines a measures from: - Autumn Budget 2024 - Ending contrived car ownership schemes: closing loopholes in Employee Car Ownership Schemes to prevent them from being used to circumvent Company Car Tax from April 2026, which is set out in Table 4.2 of Budget 2025 - Budget 2025 - Support for British automotive industry: Delay bringing Employee Car Ownership Schemes within the benefit in kind rules from 6 April 2026 to 6 April 2030, with a two year transition period which is set out in Table 4.1 of Budget 2025 Both costings have been certified by the Office for Budget Responsibility. ## Macroeconomic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant overall macroeconomic impacts. However, after April 2030, the measure is expected to have an economic impact on businesses and employers that provide vehicles through ECOS and afterwards sell the vehicles into the 'nearly new' market. This impact is predominately concentrated in the motor manufacture and motor dealership industries. ## Impact on individuals, households and families This measure will impact an estimated 80,000 individuals who currently receive cars through ECOS as they will become liable for the Income Tax associated with the benefit. The announced delay means individuals will not be impacted until 6 April 2030 This means they will have time to seek alternative arrangements with their employers. Individuals still receiving a vehicle through ECOS after 6 April 2030, subject to the transitional arrangements, may need to pay the appropriate benefit in kind charge. Impacted employees may choose to retain the current vehicle through a normal car scheme, choose a lower emitting (lower tax) vehicle or choose to go without a company car altogether. This measure is not expected to impact on family formation, stability or breakdown This measure is expected overall to have no impact on individual's experience of dealing with HMRC as the change will not"}, {"file": "Changes to Employee Car Ownership Schemes (ECOS) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "result in them having direct contact with HMRC. Where their employer continues to provide a vehicle through an ECOS arrangement, the scheme will be taxable after 6 April 2030. ## Equalities impacts An individual may be affected by this measure regardless of their protected characteristics. This measure is expected to impact on individuals who are provided with vehicles through ECOS. If a protected group is overrepresented in this population, then it will be disproportionately impacted. Those aged 35-64 (79%) are overrepresented in the population who receive a company car compared to their prevalence in the UK adult population (50%). Males are also overrepresented (79%) compared to the UK adult population (50%), as are those from a White - English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British ethnic background (88%, compared to 82% in the UK adult population). Where data were available no other protected characteristic group was estimated to be overrepresented in the population affected by this measure. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations This measure will have an effect on the 1,900 medium and large companies within the motor manufacture and motor dealership industries and 200 small and medium companies in other sectors impacted by the measure, but the additional administrative burden of interacting with HMRC is assessed to be negligible. Employers will need to familiarise themselves with the changes, make preparations and discussions with relevant employees, resolve the treatment of any specific cases, for example retired employees and then record vehicles provided through ECOS as company cars through payroll or move employees from an ECOS arrangement to a normal company car scheme. It is not anticipated there will be any ongoing costs since the majority of employers will already operate a payroll and provide benefits. The announced delay to 6 April 2030 will provide additional time for employers to familiarise themselves with the changes, restructure their arrangements where relevant and payroll any benefits. This measure is not expected to disproportionately impact civil society organisations. This measure is expected overall to affect businesses' experience of dealing with HMRC as the change will require them to account for ECOS cars through payroll like they would for normal company cars. Clear guidance will be provided to ensure that companies are aware of the change in legislation prior to the change taking place. ## Operational impact (\u00a3 million) (HMRC or other) HMRC will implement these changes as part of business-as-usual activity and at minimal cost. Changes are to legislation and guidance only. ## Other impacts This measure supports the government's climate change objectives by bringing more people into scope of the emissions-based company car regime which is designed to incentivise the take up of zero-emission vehicles. This will in turn reduce carbon dioxide emissions due to transport and improve air quality. Other impacts have been considered, and none have been identified. ## Monitoring and evaluation The measure will be monitored and assessed alongside other measures announced by the government at this and previous fiscal events. ## Further advice If you"}, {"file": "Changes to Employee Car Ownership Schemes (ECOS) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "have any questions about this change, email the Employment Benefit and Expenses Policy Team at policyemploymentbenefitsexpenses@hmrc.gov.uk.

Statistical presentation ## 2.1 Data description This is a National Statistics publication produced by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). It provides information on the number of companies raising funds, the number of subscriptions and the amounts raised through the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) and Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS). It also includes Official Statistics on social enterprises raising funds through the Social Investment Tax Relief (SITR) scheme. Further, information on the number of advance assurance requests (AAR) received by HMRC and their outcomes can be found in the statistics. The EIS and SEIS are 2 of 3 tax-based venture capital schemes that were active in the 2023 to 2024 tax year, the other being the Venture Capital Trust (https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/venture-capital-trusts-statistics) (VCT) scheme. The publication also provides information on the industrial and geographical breakdown of EIS and SEIS companies, the distribution of companies by the amounts of funds raised, and the distribution of investors by the size of their investment. The SITR scheme closed for new investment in April 2023 and is included in this publication for the purposes of updating historical data. The current release includes the first estimates for 2023 to 2024. The figures for 2021 to 2022 and 2022 to 2023 include small revisions and minor updates, arising from the receipt of a small number of further EIS1 and SEIS1 forms for these years. National Statistics are accredited official statistics (https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/accredited-official-statistics/). ## 2.2 Classification system The publication provides breakdowns on the industrial and geographical categorisation of EIS and SEIS companies, the distribution of companies by the amounts of funds raised, and the distribution of investors who claimed Income Tax (IT) relief on their EIS or SEIS investments by investment band. A unique Company Registration Number (CRN), assigned to each registered company, is used to aggregate the data. Industrial sector is categorised using the UK Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)"}, {"file": "Background quality report: venture capital schemes statistics - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "2007 (https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialcla ssificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007). It should be noted that the most recent SIC data available have been used and some companies could have changed their trade since submitting their EIS1 or SEIS1 forms, which explains some of the changes seen in the statistics year on year. SIC codes are also self-selected, and we must assume that companies have selected the right code. The geographical distribution of EIS and SEIS investments is based on the registered address of the company raising funds. This address may place the company in a different region from the region in which the business activity is carried out, and therefore a degree of caution should be exercised in the use of these data. ## 2.3 Sector coverage The EIS and SEIS companies cover all main sectors in the UK Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 2007 (https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialcla ssificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007). ## 2.4 Statistical concepts and definitions ## Tax year The statistics are aggregated into tax years. A tax year stretches from 6 April until 5 April the following calendar year. ## Number of companies or enterprises The number of companies or enterprises who have submitted EIS1, SEIS1, SITR1 forms indicating they have received investment under the scheme(s) or made AARs to HMRC, in a given tax year. ## 2.5 Statistical unit The unit in the statistics is companies receiving investment under EIS, SEIS and SITR or those who have submitted AARs. ## 2.6 Statistical population All companies who have submitted EIS1, SEIS1, SITR1 forms in the UK. This includes UK limited companies; any foreign company with a UK branch or office; and social enterprises, e.g. charity or community groups. ## 2.7 Reference area The geographic region covered by the data is the United Kingdom (UK). ## 2.8 Time coverage The statistics cover the time periods from tax year ending: - 1994 to 2024 for EIS - 2013 to 2024 for SEIS - 2015 to 2023 for SITR - 2007 to 2025 for EIS AAR - 2013 to 2025 for SEIS AAR - 2015 to 2023 for SITR AAR The time period for SITR ends in 2023 due to the closure of the scheme for new investment in April 2023. Note that for EIS, the advance assurance service has been provided since the start of the scheme, but these have been reported to HMRC from 2006 to 2007. ## 3. Statistical processing ## 3.1 Source data The statistics in this release are compiled using data collected from companies' EIS1, SEIS1 and SITR1 returns. The returns, also known as 'compliance statements', are statutory declarations that the company is compliant with the conditions of the EIS, SEIS or SITR scheme. The EIS1 and SEIS1 forms include details of investors who have indicated they will be claiming EIS/SEIS relief and the amount invested. The forms also include details of the date the shares were issued; these dates are used in the production of the statistics to record the investments within particular tax years. Social enterprises had to submit similar information under the SITR scheme using"}, {"file": "Background quality report: venture capital schemes statistics - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "the SITR1 form. The EIS1 and SEIS1 forms also include the number of subscriptions, indication of whether the company is knowledge intensive (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/usethe-enterprise-investment-scheme-eis-to-raise-money-for-research-development-orinnovation) (KI) and the registered address of the company. IT Self Assessment returns are used to collect EIS and SEIS investor level information. Some investors will invest in both schemes in the same tax year. This information will not cover investors making IT relief claims through other systems (eg PAYE) or not making any claims. Data on AARs are retrieved from AAR applications received by HMRC. This includes the date the applications were received and the outcome of the application (ie approved, rejected or pending). ## 3.2 Frequency of data collection The data for venture capital scheme investments and AAR are collected annually. This year's statistics are based on data extracted in March 2025. ## 3.3 Data collection The data cover all EIS1, SEIS1 and SITR1 returns received by HMRC and approved by the Venture Capital Reliefs Team (VCRT) which administers the schemes. Companies are required to submit an EIS1/SEIS1 form for each share issue where EIS or SEIS relief is to be claimed. The VCRT decides if a company and a share issue qualifies for the scheme. The data from the compliance forms is then uploaded to HMRC's electronic database. Data on AARs are collected by the VCRT and compiled from AAR applications. The data cover all the AAR applications handled by the VCRT. The VCRT advises companies or enterprises considering using the venture capital schemes about whether HMRC will regard their planned share issues, loans and business activities as satisfying the requirements of the scheme. Similarly the data is uploaded to HMRC's electronic database. IT relief data is collected from Self Assessment returns received by HMRC and is available on HMRC's Self Assessment database. ## 3.4 Data validation Initial checks carried out on the data include: Plausibility checking ie ensuring that the amount of the investment has a realistic value. Any record showing a very high amount is referred to VCRT, who will check on these cases. Checks are carried out to ensure that the companies correspond to the correct company registration number (CRN). In case of inconsistencies, the correct information is retrieved from the Companies House Database or VCRT. Checks are carried out to flag duplicate records, ie individual companies' records with the same issue date and amount of investment are checked with VCRT. Once the data from EIS1, SEIS1 and SITR1 forms have been extracted from the analysis database, any significant changes in figures from one statistical release to the next are investigated. In tax years 2021 to 2022, 2022 to 2023 and 2023 to 2024, a number of advance assurance applications were initially returned due to either not completing a mandatory checklist, no agent authority or using an old form. The applications were subsequently resubmitted to HMRC and final outcomes reached. Therefore, we have excluded these 'rejections' from the number of applications rejected in these years. ## 3.5 Data compilation ## Dealing with"}, {"file": "Background quality report: venture capital schemes statistics - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "missing data For companies with certain fields missing (for example postcodes) the relevant fields are updated using information provided by companies to Companies House, which is accessed through Bureau van Dijk's Financial Analysis Made Easy (https://www.bvdinfo.com/en-gb/our-products/data/national/fame) (FAME) product. If the missing postcode data is not populated through FAME, the record will be marked as 'unknown' in the geographical classification. ## Aggregating data Data are aggregated using a unique CRN assigned to each company. This unique number does not change across tax years. Self Assessment data are aggregated using a unique taxpayer reference (UTR) assigned to each company. ## 4. Quality Management Our statistical practice is regulated by the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR). OSR sets the standards of trustworthiness, quality and value in the Code of Practice for Statistics (https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/the-code/) that all producers of official statistics should adhere to. You are welcome to contact us directly with any comments about how we meet these standards by emailing venturecapital.statistics@hmrc.gov.uk. Alternatively, you can contact OSR by emailing regulation@statistics.gov.uk or via the OSR website. The Enterprise Investment Scheme, Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme and Social Investment Tax Relief statistics were independently reviewed by the Office for Statistics Regulation in June 2013. They comply with the standards of trustworthiness, quality and value in the Code of Practice for Statistics (https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/the-code/) and should be labelled 'accredited official statistics'. Accredited official statistics are called National Statistics in the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007. ## 4.1 Quality assurance All official statistics produced by KAI, must meet the standards in the Code of Practice for Statistics (https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/the-code/) produced by the UK Statistics Authority and all analysts adhere to best practice as set out in the 'Quality' pillar. Analytical Quality Assurance describes the arrangements and procedures put in place to ensure analytical outputs are error free and fit-for-purpose. It is an essential part of KAI's way of working as the complexity of our work and the speed at which we are asked to provide advice means there is a high risk of error which can have serious consequences on KAI's and HMRC's reputation, decisions, and in turn on peoples' lives. Every piece of analysis is unique, and as a result there is no single quality assurance (QA) checklist that contains all the QA tasks needed for every project. Nonetheless, analysts in KAI use a checklist which summarises the key QA tasks, and is used as a starting point for teams when they are considering what QA actions to undertake. Teams amend and adapt it as they see fit, to take account of the level of risk associated with their analysis, and the different QA tasks that are relevant to the work. At the start of a project, during the planning stage, analysts and managers make a risk-based decision on what level of QA is required. Analysts and managers construct a plan for all the QA tasks that will need to be completed, along with documentation on how each of those tasks are to be carried out, and turn this"}, {"file": "Background quality report: venture capital schemes statistics - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "list into a QA checklist specific to the project. Analysts carry out the QA tasks, update the checklist, and pass onto the Senior Responsible Officer for review and eventual sign off. ## 4.2 Quality assessment The QA for this project adhered to the framework described in '4.1 Quality assurance' and the specific procedures undertaken were as follows: ## Stage 1 - Specifying the question Up to date documentation was agreed with stakeholders setting out outputs needed and by when; how the outputs will be used; and all the parameters required for the analysis. ## Stage 2 - Developing the methodology Methodology was agreed and developed in collaboration with stakeholders and others with relevant expertise, ensuring it was fit for purpose and would deliver the required outputs. ## Stage 3 - Building and populating a model/piece of code Stage 3 consists of the following steps: - analysis was produced using the most appropriate software and in line with good practice guidance - data inputs were checked to ensure they were fit-for-purpose by reviewing available documentation and, where possible, through direct contact with data suppliers - QA of the input data was carried out - the analysis was audited by someone other than the lead analyst - checking code and methodology ## Stage 4 - Running and testing the model/code Stage 4 consists of the following: - results were compared with those produced in previous years and differences understood and determined to be genuine - results were determined to be explainable and in line with expectations ## Stage 5 - Drafting the final output The final stage includes the following: - checks were completed to ensure internal consistency (eg totals equal the sum of the components) - the final outputs were independently proof read and checked ## 5. Relevance ## 5.1 User needs This analysis is likely to be of interest to users under the following broad headings: - policy makers in government - academia and research bodies - media - venture capital associations - companies raising funds under the schemes - investors investing in venture capital schemes ## 5.2 User satisfaction HMRC is committed to providing impartial quality statistics which meet our users' needs. We encourage our users to engage with us so that we can improve our National and Official Statistics and identify gaps in the statistics that we produce. Since the recent few years we have published statistics on the EIS, SEIS and SITR as an annual release, combining the previous April and October publications. This allows us to provide breakdowns of the EIS and SEIS data earlier in the year and makes it easier for users to find the statistics that they need. If you would like to comment on these statistics or have any enquiries, please use the statistical contacts named at the beginning of the report. ## 5.3 Completeness Tables 1 to 10, 12 to 21 and 23 include every case captured via EIS1, SEIS1 and SITR1 forms respectively.

Since the compliance forms are mandatory for investors to claim tax relief, the data is likely to be complete. ## 6. Accuracy and reliability ## 6.1 Overall accuracy This analysis is based on administrative data, and accuracy is addressed by eliminating non-sampling errors as much as possible through adherence to the quality assurance framework. The potential sources of error include: - companies entering incorrect information onto the compliance forms - human or software error when entering the compliance form data into HMRC's system - the accuracy and consistency of the assignment of SIC 2007, when classifying companies by industry sector - mistakes in the programming code used to analyse the data and produce the statistics ## 6.2 Sampling error As no sampling is necessary, sampling error is not an issue. ## 6.3 Non-sampling error ## Coverage error The Self Assessment tables (Tables 9, 10, 20 and 21) include every case captured via Self Assessment returns. Therefore, the data only includes companies who have claimed Income Tax relief via Self Assessment forms (rather than through PAYE for example). ## Measurement error The main sources of measurement error could be categorised as respondent errors. Companies may make errors entering their information on the EIS1, SEIS1 and SITR1 forms. The data are subsequently entered onto HMRC's systems manually. This is another point at which data may be altered due to human error or software errors. There is a risk that errors involve very large investment amounts. To mitigate this, checks are carried out and any incorrect large values which are detected are investigated (and potentially altered) in the analysis database before the statistics are produced. In addition, companies are classified by industrial sector using the self-selected SIC 2007 from FAME. We must assume that companies have selected the correct industrial sector. ## Nonresponse error Nonresponse errors may arise if a company does not submit their compliance statements to HMRC. However, compliance statements are mandatory in order for companies to claim EIS, SEIS and SITR relief, thus the effect of nonresponse error should be minimal. ## Processing error It is possible that errors exist in the programming code used to analyse the data and produce the statistics. This risk is reduced through developing a good understanding of the complexities of venture capital schemes, and thoroughly reviewing and testing the programs that are used. ## 6.4 Data revision ## Data revision - policy The United Kingdom Statistics Authority (UKSA) Code of Practice for Official Statistics requires all producers of Official Statistics to publish transparent guidance on the policy for revisions. ## Data revision - practice The EIS, SEIS and SITR companies have a period of several years after shares are issued to submit a compliance statement. Therefore, there are a small number of returns submitted later which add to the existing data and can therefore result in minor"}, {"file": "Background quality report: venture capital schemes statistics - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "revisions to previously published figures. This release provides figures on the number of investors and the amount claimed through Self Assessment in value terms. The EIS and SEIS investors can claim Income Tax relief up to five years after the 31 January following the tax year in which the investment was made. We have applied an uplift factor to the figures for 2022 to 2023 onwards, to account for returns yet to be received by HMRC. This uplift factor is based on the percentage increase in returns from the previous publication, where we have assumed the number of returns will increase at a similar proportion in next year's release. Therefore, these figures should be treated as provisional and will be subject to revisions in future publications. The figures for 2021 to 2022 and 2022 to 2023 have been revised as a result of more returns being received by HMRC since last year's publication. Note that since these figures were uplifted last year, the revised figures can be slightly smaller or larger than in the previous release. Companies can also change their registered address or selected industrial SIC 2007 which would lead to revisions to the geographical and sectoral breakdowns for EIS and SEIS. ## 6.5 Seasonal adjustment Seasonal adjustment is not applicable for this analysis. ## 7. Timeliness and punctuality ## 7.1 Timeliness All data including funds raised under the schemes, investors claiming IT relief and AAR applications are published in May 2025. Data on amount of funds raised under the schemes covers shares issued up to the end of tax year 2023 to 2024 (5 April 2024). Data on investors claiming IT relief covers returns received for up to the end of tax year 2023 to 2024. Information on AAR relates to applications received up to the end of tax year 2024 to 2025. ## 7.2 Punctuality In accordance with the Code of Practice for official statistics, the exact date of publication will be given not less than one calendar month before publication on both the Schedule of updates for HMRC's statistics (https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/schedule-of-updates-for-hmrcs-statistics) and the Research and statistics (https://www.gov.uk/search/research-and-statistics? content_store_document_type=upcoming_statistics) calendar of GOV.UK.

If SIC 2007 data is not populated through FAME, this is classified under 'Unknown SIC2007' in the industrial breakdowns. Quality assurance checks are undertaken on SIC code analysis, but since the codes are standardised, coherence issues should be minimal and not impactful.

In certain circumstances, having an agent in the UK will meet this requirement. ## Fixed place of business The critical part of whether you're permanently established in the UK, is if the business carried out at that place forms an essential and substantial part of your business. Examples which indicate you're permanently established include having an office or factory, or one of the following: - a place of management - a branch - a workshop - a quarry, mine, oil or gas well - a building site, such as a construction or installation project This isn't an exhaustive list, and the type of business your company carries out will be the deciding factor in what premises and facilities are required to meet the condition. ## Group companies If you're a holding company, the business of your trading subsidiaries doesn't have to be carried on from your premises. The administrative and management functions of your company will likely be enough to count for the permanent establishment condition. If you're an overseas-registered parent company, you must have a permanent establishment in the UK yourself in order to qualify.

This publication is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/construction-industryscheme-tackling-fraud/tackling-construction-industry-scheme-fraud ## Who is likely to be affected Businesses who operate within the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) who knowingly enter into transactions connected to fraud will be affected by these measures. ## General description of the measure These measures tackle the small minority of businesses who knowingly engage with fraudulent businesses who evade tax. Where it can be shown that a business knew or should have known that they entered into a transaction that was connected with the fraudulent evasion of tax, the measures: 1. Provide for the immediate cancellation of Gross Payment Status (GPS). 2. Make the business who entered into the transaction connected to fraud liable for the lost tax. 3. Allows a penalty of 30% of the lost tax to be charged to the business found liable, as well as to its directors and other persons connected to the business. The time limit for reapplication where GPS has been immediately removed is also increased from one year to 5 years. The other grounds for immediate GPS cancellation are where a business has provided false information at registration for GPS, has fraudulently made an incorrect return or provided incorrect information, or knowingly failed to comply with a CIS obligation. ## Policy objective These measures support the government's objective to close the tax gap, tackle non-compliance and make the tax system fairer. These measures protect the Exchequer from revenue losses - this will also reduce the large sums of money going to organised criminal gangs involved in supply chain fraud in construction or involving CIS deductions. They also ensure that there is level playing field by preventing fraudulent operators under-cutting the compliant businesses that operate within the rules. Changes to this legislation ensures these businesses undertake the necessary due diligence to prevent illegitimate operators from entering the market. Where businesses do knowingly engage in fraudulent supply chains, GPS will be removed immediately and the business will be made liable for the tax losses, and penalties will be chargeable on the business itself and its directors, or other persons connected to the business. ## Background to the measure Supply chain fraud relies on businesses within the supply chain entering transactions they know are connected to fraud or"}, {"file": "Tackling Construction Industry Scheme fraud - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "ignore clear signs of fraud where there is no other reasonable explanation for the transaction to take place other than it being connected to fraud. These businesses often repeatedly engage with businesses that go missing or default on payments. There have been several reforms in recent years to tackle non-compliance within the construction sector. In 2021 changes were made to reduce the abuse of the CIS, and to tackle VAT losses due to supply chain fraud. In 2023, we consulted on measures to further strengthen the scheme and introduced legislation in April 2024 to bolster the GPS tests. These powers are helping HMRC tackle fraud and non-compliance within the scheme. However, serious non-compliance in the construction sector continues to develop and remains a significant risk, including sophisticated fraud by criminals. These measures were modelled on VAT countermeasures that have been effective at disrupting supply chain fraud losses. The VAT countermeasures apply to those in the supply chain that have entered transactions that they knew or should have known were connected to the fraudulent evasion of VAT. The measure was first announced at Budget 2025. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date All measures come into effect from 6 April 2026. ## Current law The current CIS legislation can be found in Part 3, Chapter 3 and Schedule 11 Finance Act 2004 (FA04) and in the Income Tax (Construction Industry Scheme) Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/2045). ## Proposed revisions Legislation will be introduced in Finance Bill 2025-26 to amend Part 3, Chapter 3 in FA04 and S.I. 2005/2045. Section 66(3) in FA04 will be amended to provide the power to immediately remove GPS where a business knew or should have known that the payments made or received were connected with fraudulent evasion of tax. Section 66(7) of FA04 is amended to prevent re-application for a period of 5 years where GPS is cancelled under Section 66(3) of FA04. New legislation will also be introduced in Part 3, Chapter 3 FA04 and S.I 2005/2045 to allow the business that knew or should have known that the payments made or received were connected with fraudulent evasion of tax liable for the lost tax and penalties of up 30% of the lost tax. The officers of the business could also be liable for these penalties. ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3 million) 2025 to 2026 to 2027 to 2028 to 2029 to 2030 to | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 | 2031 | |--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------| | +25 | +205 | +165 | +140 | +120 | +110 | These figures are set out in table 4.1 of Budget 2025 and have been certified by the Office for Budget Responsibility.

The majority of those businesses with GPS are companies rather than sole traders and most businesses involved in supply chain fraud are companies. It is therefore not anticipated that there will be disproportionate impacts on those groups sharing protected characteristics. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations This measure should not impact compliant businesses in the construction industry who undertake the due diligence required to ensure those they contract with in the supply chain are not engaged in supply chain fraud. The measures aimed at tackling supply chain fraud will only impact those who knowingly engage with fraudulent businesses. This measure is not expected to disproportionately impact civil society organisations. ## Operational impact (\u00a3 million) (HMRC or other) The extension of the period a business can reapply for GPS and the new penalties will need changes to HMRC systems. We currently estimate this will cost circa \u00a31.1 million. The proposed measures to tackle CIS fraud will not have an impact on full time equivalent (FTE) resource requirements. ## Other impacts Other impacts have been considered and none have been identified. ## Monitoring and evaluation Consideration will be given to monitoring this measure through information collected from GPS removal data and supply chain investigations and kept under review through analysing this data and the impact on fraud. ## Further advice If you have any questions about this change, please contact the CIS policy team by email cisconsultations@hmrc.gov.uk.

The first alternative is that the entirety of their UK income is assessed, they may claim their Personal Allowance, and their UK dividends are granted a tax credit at the Ordinary Rate. The second alternative is that only their UK rental or partnership income is taxable, however they may not claim their Personal Allowance. This tax credit was initially introduced to match the Ordinary Rate tax credit on dividends for UK residents but was not repealed when the UK resident tax credit was abolished. This measure abolishes the tax credit and brings non-UK residents in line with UK residents. ## Policy objective This measure will improve fairness in the UK tax system as it will prevent nonUK residents from receiving a tax credit which is not available to UK residents. ## Background to the measure This measure was announced at Budget 2025. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date The measure will have effect for distributions received on and after 6 April 2026. ## Current law The current law is included in Chapter 3 of Part 4, section 399 Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005 ('section 399'). ## Proposed revisions This measure will repeal the legislation at section 399, which will have the effect of abolishing the notional tax credit. Consequential changes will also be made to omit references to section 399 from the Income Tax Act 2007, Taxes Management Act 1970 and Unauthorised Unit Trust Regulations 2013. ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3 million) | 2025 to | 2026 to | 2027 to | 2028 to | 2029 to | 2030 to | |-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 | 2031 | negligible negligible negligible negligible negligible negligible This measure is expected to have a negligible impact"}, {"file": "Abolition of the notional tax credit on dividends received by non-UK residents - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "on the Exchequer. ## Macroeconomic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. ## Impact on individuals, households and families This measure will not impact UK resident individuals. It will impact fewer than 1,000 non-resident individuals a year with UK dividend income and UK rental or partnership income, who will no longer receive the notional tax credit in relation to UK dividends. This measure is expected overall to have no impact on individuals' experience of dealing with HMRC as the change will not result in any new obligations or alter any processes. These individuals will continue submitting a Self Assessment to HMRC, and the information required from the individual has not changed. The measure is not expected to impact on family formation, stability or breakdown. ## Equalities impacts This measure will impact individuals who are non-UK resident and receive dividends from UK companies and UK rental or partnership income. HMRC does not currently hold data on the protected characteristics of individuals impacted by this measure and so cannot make an assessment of the impacts on those with shared protected characteristics. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations This measure will have a negligible impact on businesses as it concerns the taxation of individuals. Businesses that provide tax advice to individuals will need to be aware of the impact of this measure on their clients. One-off costs will include familiarisation with the changes. It is not anticipated they will incur any continuing costs. Customer experience is expected to remain broadly the same as this measure does not alter how businesses interact with HMRC. This measure is not expected to impact civil society organisations. ## Operational impact (\u00a3 million) (HMRC or other) Changes to the Income Tax Self Assessment system will be made. These changes are anticipated to cost in the region of \u00a32.32 million. ## Other impacts Other impacts have been considered and none have been identified. ## Monitoring and evaluation The measure will be monitored through information collected from tax returns and internal HMRC compliance risk evaluation work. ## Further advice If you have any questions about this change, contact the Personal Tax International Policy Team by email: personaltaxinternational@hmrc.gov.uk.

Relief at the lower rate of 50% will apply to the value of any qualifying relievable property over \u00a31 million. Combined with the nil-rate bands, this means two individuals could pass on up to \u00a33 million tax-free between them. Any unused amount of the \u00a31 million allowance can be transferred to a surviving spouse or civil partner from 6 April 2026. If the first death was before 6 April 2026, it will be assumed the entirety of the \u00a31 million allowance will be available for transfer to the surviving spouse or civil partner. A \u00a31 million allowance will also apply to the combined value of relievable agricultural and business property in trusts. The rate of business property relief available will be reduced from 100% to 50% in all circumstances for shares admitted to trading on recognised stock exchanges (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/designated-recognised-stockexchanges-section-1005-income-tax-act-2007) designated as 'not listed'. The rate of relief will also reduce from 100% to 50% for qualifying shares listed on foreign exchanges which are not a recognised stock exchange. The option to pay Inheritance Tax by equal annual instalments over 10 years interest-free will be extended to all property which is eligible for agricultural property relief or business property relief. The method to calculate rates of Inheritance Tax on trust exit charges will be standardised so that all exit charges will be calculated based on unrelieved values, regardless of"}, {"file": "Agricultural property relief and business property relief changes - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "whether the exit takes place before or after the first 10-year anniversary. ## Policy objective The purpose of the reforms is to raise revenue to make sure the sustainability of the public finances and to fund public services, whilst continuing to support farms and businesses by targeting the reliefs to make them fairer. ## Background to the measure Agricultural property relief and business property relief reduces the value of assets when working out how much Inheritance Tax has to be paid. Since March 1992, relief of up to 100% has been available on qualifying business and agricultural assets. A very small number of claimants each year claim a very significant amount of agricultural property relief and business property relief. In 2021 to 2022, 40% of the total Exchequer cost of agricultural property relief went to the top 7% of claims This means just 117 estates benefited from \u00a3219 million in tax foregone. 73% of estates claimed for agricultural property below \u00a31 million, and the median value of assets qualifying for agricultural property relief overall was \u00a3486,000. In 2021 to 2022, 53% of the Exchequer cost of business property relief went to just the top 4% of claims. This means just 158 estates benefited from \u00a3558 million in tax foregone. 87% of estates claimed for business property below \u00a31 million, and the median value of assets qualifying for business property relief overall was \u00a3200,000. At Autumn Budget 2024, the government announced it would reform agricultural property relief and business property relief from 6 April 2026. A detailed summary of the reforms (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agriculturalproperty-relief-and-business-property-relief-reforms/), including statistical analysis of 2021 to 2022 data, was published at Autumn Budget 2024. A detailed explanation (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/what-are-the-changes-to-agriculturalproperty-relief) on the reforms to agricultural property relief was published and will be updated at Budget 2025. The government published a technical consultation on how the reforms would apply to trusts on 27 February 2025. The consultation included announcements on the broader extension of interest-free instalments and standardisation of exit charge rate calculations. A summary of responses (https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/reforms-to-inheritance-tax-reliefsconsultation-on-property-settled-into-trust/) to the consultation was published on 21 July 2025. At Budget 2025, the government announced any unused \u00a31 million allowance for the 100% rate of agricultural property relief and business property relief will be transferable between spouses and civil partners, including if the first death was before 6 April 2026. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date The measure will have effect from 6 April 2026. Transitional rules mean that the operative date for chargeable lifetime transfers and trust charges will have effect for deaths occurring on or after 6 April 2026 where lifetime gifts were made on or after 30 October 2024 and the transferor dies on or after 6 April 2026, and within 7 years of making the gift. Where a first spouse or civil partner died before 6 April 2026, it will be assumed they had a full \u00a31 million allowance to transfer on the death of the surviving spouse or civil partner on or after 6 April 2026. The measure will"}, {"file": "Agricultural property relief and business property relief changes - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "have an effect on trusts existing before 30 October 2024 from the next 10-year anniversary occurring on or after 6 April 2026. For new trusts, or existing trusts which did not contain agricultural or business property on or before 30 October 2024, the measure will have an effect from 30 October 2024 regarding the availability of 100% relief, as it will depend on the value of transfers of qualifying property made into the trust on or after 30 October 2024. ## Current law Inheritance Tax legislation is provided for in the Inheritance Tax Act 1984. Part V (miscellaneous reliefs), Chapters 1 and 2 provide relief for business property and agricultural property respectively. Part III (settlements without interest in possession and certain settlements in which interests in possession subsist) contains the rules on settled property, with Chapter 3 of that part containing the separate charging regime for property held in trusts. Part VI (valuation) contains the valuation rules in relation to Scottish agricultural leases. Part VIII (administration and collection) contains the rules on the property on which inheritance tax can be paid by instalments. ## Proposed revisions The government will introduce legislation in Finance Bill 2025-26 to amend the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 with effect from 6 April 2026. Sections 104 (business property relief) and 116 (agricultural property relief) will be amended to refer to a new 100% relief allowance, with a 50% rate applying for everything over that allowance, and to provide that the rate of business property relief available on shares will be 50% in all cases where they are: - admitted to trading on a recognised stock exchange which are not 'listed' - qualifying shares listed on foreign exchanges which are not a recognised stock exchange A new Chapter 2A will be inserted to provide for a \u00a31 million allowance for individuals and a \u00a31 million trust allowance. This will allow for the transfer of an individual's unused \u00a31 million allowance to their surviving spouse or civil partner, including transfer of a full \u00a31 million allowance if the first death was before 6 April 2026. Commencement provisions will be made in the Finance Bill for transitional arrangements in respect of transfers before 6 April 2026 and trusts existing before 30 October 2024. Section 69 will be amended so that all relevant property trust exit charge rates are calculated based on values before agricultural property relief or business property relief regardless of whether the exit takes place before or after the first 10-year anniversary. Exemption for certain Scottish agricultural leases is preserved by amending section 177. Section 227 (payment by instalments - land, shares and businesses) will be amended so that the Inheritance tax liability, in relation to all shares that qualify for business property relief will be able to be paid by instalments, without having to satisfy the conditions in Section 228. Amendments to Section 234 (interest on instalments) extends interest relief to the instalment payments on these shares. ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3 million)"}, {"file": "Agricultural property relief and business property relief changes - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "Policy announced at Autumn Budget 2024 (updated with latest Budget 2025 economic determinants). | 2025 to 2026 | 2026 to 2027 | 2027 to 2028 | 2028 to 2029 | 2029 to 2030 | 2030 to 2031 | |----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------| | - | +235 | +495 | +515 | +505 | +505 | These figures are set out in Table 4.2 of Budget 2025 and have been certified by the Office for Budget Responsibility.

More details can be found in the policy costings document published alongside Budget 2025. ## Macroeconomic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. ## Impact on individuals, households and families Inheritance Tax is a wealth transfer tax on the estate (the property, money and possessions) of someone who has died and on assets in relevant trusts. From 6 April 2026, this measure will increase Inheritance Tax liabilities for a small number of estates each year and therefore reduce the inheritance received by beneficiaries. HMRC does not hold complete data on the beneficiaries of estates because it is not required for the administration of Inheritance Tax. Based on the latest Budget 2025 economic determinants and the latest available complete administrative data, also reflecting the impact of the announcement at Budget 2025 that the \u00a31 million allowance is transferable between spouses, the reforms are expected to result in around 1,400 estates across the UK paying more Inheritance Tax in 2026 to 2027. This a reduction from around 2,000 estates forecast to pay more at Autumn Budget 2024. Of the 1,400 estates, up to 375 estates claiming agricultural property relief, including those also claiming business property relief, are expected to pay more Inheritance Tax in 2026 to 2027. This a reduction from up to 520 estates forecast to pay more at Autumn Budget 2024. This means almost three-quarters of all estates claiming agricultural property relief in 2026 to 2027, including those that also claim for business property relief, are still forecast to not pay any more Inheritance Tax as a result of the changes. Of the 1,400 estates, up to 1,025 estates only claiming business property relief are expected to pay more Inheritance Tax in 2026 to 2027, of which around 700 of these are expected to only hold shares designated as 'not listed' on the markets of recognised stock exchanges. This a reduction from up to 1,500 estates forecast to pay more at Autumn Budget 2024, of which around 1,000"}, {"file": "Agricultural property relief and business property relief changes - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "were expected to only hold shares designated as 'not listed' on the markets of recognised stock exchanges. This means around three-quarters of all estates only claiming business property relief in 2026 to 2027, excluding those only holding shares designated as 'not listed', are still forecast to not pay any more Inheritance Tax as a result of the changes. These estimates are static and assume no change in behaviour, such as tax planning, which may reduce the numbers of estates affected. As such, these estimates should be viewed as a maximum. The Exchequer impact above includes the anticipated behavioural response whereby individuals restructure their estates by making greater use of other available reliefs and exemptions. Personal representatives for the deceased's estate, individuals who settle agricultural and business property into trusts and their respective trustees already need to undertake some administration to report and pay Inheritance Tax. Where they plan to claim the reliefs, they will need to familiarise themselves with the changes. The majority of personal representatives claiming the reliefs will not face additional ongoing administrative burdens. For the estates which only hold shares that are not listed, there are no new obligations as the only change will be an update to the rate of the relief and there will be no change to how they interact with HMRC. Where the estate now seeks to claim the relief for assets in excess of \u00a31 million, personal representatives will need to undertake an additional calculation at the reduced 50% rate. This will be reflected on updated forms and guidance. Individuals who settle property into trust and trustees will need to make sure they keep records of how they have used the allowance and also have to undertake an additional calculation at chargeable events for assets in excess of \u00a31 million. Trustees will need to calculate a different rate for an exit after a 10-year anniversary. This measure will affect these individuals' experience of dealing with HMRC as it will require some additional administration. HMRC will provide guidance and tools to support individuals, trustees and personal representatives to calculate the Inheritance Tax that is due. The measure will have an impact on families going through bereavement and those planning for succession, where the estate has an increased Inheritance Tax liability as a result of this measure. The policy is not expected to have a significant impact on family formation, family stability or family breakdown. ## Equalities impacts The impact of this measure on groups with protected characteristics is expected to be proportionate with the population of the estates claiming the reliefs, and where protected groups are overrepresented there will be a disproportionate impact. However, as detailed above, individuals may seek to restructure their affairs in response to changes, depending on their personal circumstances. HMRC collects data about the age, sex and marital status of the deceased. In 2022 to 2023, the most recent data available, the majority of agricultural property relief (83%) and business property relief (76%) was claimed by the estates of"}, {"file": "Agricultural property relief and business property relief changes - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "individuals aged 75 or over. In 2022 to 2023, the majority of these reliefs were claimed by males rather than females (61% of agricultural property relief, 58% of business property relief). Around half of those estates belonged to widows or widowers (50% for agricultural property relief, 52% for business property relief), and around one-fifth were married (22% for agricultural property relief, 22% for business property relief). HMRC does not hold data on the other protected characteristics of deceased individuals with estates liable for Inheritance Tax and so cannot make an assessment of the impacts on those with shared protected characteristics. This measure will have an indirect impact on the beneficiaries of estates or trusts liable to Inheritance Tax as the value of the estate or trust after Inheritance Tax is paid will be lower than it otherwise would have been. HMRC does not hold complete data on the beneficiaries of estates or trusts, therefore it is not possible to make an assessment of the impacts on those with shared protected characteristics. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations This measure concerns taxation of individuals, estates and trusts. The majority of those submitting Inheritance Tax returns are agents and whilst some individuals will choose family members to be trustees of their estates, others may appoint professional estate planners and financial advisers. This measure will have a negligible administrative impact on these businesses. One-off costs may include overall business familiarisation with the changes, upskilling staff on process changes, and updating software to facilitate completing updated forms. Ongoing costs will relate to the same administrative activities as those for non-professionals detailed under 'impact on individuals, households and families'. This measure is expected to affect these businesses' experience of dealing with HMRC as in a minority of cases it will require professional personal representatives and trustees to add to their existing administrative processes when claiming the reliefs. As with non-professionals, HMRC will mitigate the impact on trustees and personal representatives by providing guidance and tools to enable them to calculate the Inheritance Tax that is due. How individuals structure their business and agricultural assets in response to this measure, including succession planning, will depend on their personal circumstances. Similarly, the means by which individuals, personal representatives or trustees pay the Inheritance Tax liability, for example through business assets or through other assets within the estate or trust, as a lump sum or through interest-free instalments, will depend on personal choices and individual circumstances. The proposal is expected to have a limited impact on civil society organisations such as those who support bereaved families and provide advice on relevant issues (such as Citizens Advice). This may include one-off costs such as familiarisation. There are not expected to be any further one-off or continuing costs. ## Operational impact (\u00a3 million) (HMRC or other) Current estimates of HMRC costs to deliver the measure are \u00a39.2 million in total over the scorecard period based on existing systems. These costs are primarily staffing costs to support the"}, {"file": "Agricultural property relief and business property relief changes - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "administration of this measure. As with all measures, costs will be further refined as data is collected on the behavioural response to the changes. ## Other impacts ## Food security The UK has robust domestic production, and these reforms will only affect a small number of estates. Key aspects of UK food security include prices and physical availability, and changes to inheritance tax reliefs are not expected to have a material impact on either. UK agricultural prices (including for domestic production) are typically a function of international prices. Marginal changes in domestic production, if any, would not affect this relationship and would not be expected to have a material impact on UK prices. Furthermore, changes to inheritance tax reliefs would not be expected to impact the UK's ability to source imports from international markets. Overall, this measure is not expected to have a material impact on food security. ## Monitoring and evaluation The measure will be monitored through information collected from Inheritance Tax returns and communication with affected taxpayer groups. ## Further advice If you have any questions about this change, email the Inheritance Tax Policy team at abrbpr.consult@hmrc.gov.uk.

This publication is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/changes-to-gamblingduties/gambling-duty-changes ## Who is likely to be affected Remote gaming providers who are liable to account for Remote Gaming Duty. Remote Gaming Duty applies to gaming over the internet, telephone, by television, radio, or any other electronic communications or other technology for facilitating communication. Gambling operators who provide remote betting and are liable to account for General Betting Duty. General Betting Duty is charged on bets made with a bookmaker in UK premises or remotely (for example online) by a person in the UK regardless of where in the world the bookmaker is located. Businesses who provide bingo in a UK licensed premises. ## General description of the measure ## Remote Gaming Duty The rate of Remote Gaming Duty will be increased from 21% to 40% from 1 April 2026. ## General Betting Duty A new rate of General Betting Duty will be introduced for general bets made remotely (for example online) from 1 April 2027. The remote rate of 25% will apply to all remote betting other than remote bets on UK horseracing which will remain unchanged, in line with land based betting, in recognition that operators contribute 10% towards the statutory Horserace Betting Levy, resulting in an existing de-facto 25% rate for bets on UK horse races. Bets placed via selfservice betting terminals on licenced betting premises will not be treated as being placed remotely and will remain subject to the 15% rate for general bets. The General Betting Duty rates for general bets made in UK premises, horse and dog pool bets, financial spread bets and non-financial spread bets remain unchanged. ## Bingo Duty Bingo duty will be abolished with effect from 1 April 2026. ## Penalties The penalty provisions for General Betting Duty, Remote Gaming Duty and Pool Betting Duty will be updated to ensure that the current legislation reflects the provisions of Finance Act 2014. ## Policy objective Increasing gambling duties will raise over \u00a31 billion per year to support the public finances and form part of our ambition to create a fair, modern and sustainable tax system. The government has targeted the biggest increase in tax on remote gaming (for example online slots and casino games), which is generally considered to have"}, {"file": "Gambling duty changes - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "lower operating costs and to be more harmful than other forms of gambling. The intention of the Remote Gaming Duty rate increase is to disincentivise gambling companies from pushing consumers towards what are considered more harmful products. The government has sought to balance evidence and views that remote betting is not as harmful as remote gaming, whilst also recognising the growth in online betting and its lower costs compared to retail operations. The government will therefore implement a lower tax rise for remote betting than remote gaming, while keeping General Betting Duty at 15%. Remote bets on UK horseracing will remain unchanged, in line with land based betting, in recognition that operators contribute 10% towards the statutory Horserace Betting Levy, resulting in an existing de-facto 25% rate for bets on UK horse races. The repeal of Bingo Duty supports lower risk activities and bingo clubs and simplifies the tax system by removing one of 7 gambling duties. The changes to the wording of the Finance Act 2007 will provide clarity in relation to the penalty regimes that apply for General Betting Duty, Remote Gaming Duty and Pool Betting Duty. ## Background to the measure At Autumn Budget 2024, the government announced its intention to consult on reforms to the tax treatment of remote gambling, aiming to modernise and simplify the tax system. The consultation ran from 23 April to 21 July 2025. It sought views on introducing a single Remote Betting and Gaming Duty covering all remote betting and gaming activities, including online casinos, bingo, slots and sports betting. The government has carefully considered all responses to the consultation as well as views shared by stakeholders during extensive engagement over the summer and in the lead up to the Budget. The government heard representations that remote betting and remote gaming are different in terms of costs and harms and should therefore not be subject to a single duty at the same rate. Consequently, the government will not proceed with introducing a Remote Betting and Gaming Duty rate, and will instead introduce changes that retain a differential between rates on remote betting and gaming duties. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative dates ## Remote Gaming Duty The new duty rate of 40% will apply for accounting periods that begin on or after 1 April 2026 and will be chargeable on profits on remote gaming from that date onwards. Where this date falls part-way through an accounting period, the increased rate will be charged only on the profits that arise between 1 April 2026 and the end of that accounting period. ## General Betting Duty The new duty rate of 25% for remote betting will be chargeable on profits from remote betting from 1 April 2027 onwards. Remote betting on UK horse racing will be excluded from the new duty rate, as will any bets placed via self-service betting terminals on licenced premises, and these will instead remain chargeable at a rate of 15%. ## Bingo Duty Finance Bill 2025-26 will repeal Bingo"}, {"file": "Gambling duty changes - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "Duty with effect from 1 April 2026. ## Current law ## General Betting Duty General Betting Duty legislation is contained in the Finance Act 2014 (Part 3, Chapter 1). ## Remote Gaming Duty Remote Gaming Duty legislation is contained in the Finance Act 2014 (Part 3, Chapter 3). ## Bingo Duty Bingo Duty legislation is contained in sections 17 to 20C and schedule 3 of the Betting and Gaming Duties Act 1981 and the Bingo Duty Regulations 2003. ## Penalties The penalty provisions are contained in Schedule 24 of Finance Act 2014. ## Proposed revisions Legislation will be introduced in Finance Bill 2025-26 that: - amends section 155(3) of Finance Act 2014.

In response, some individuals could choose to gamble less, switch to alternative gambling activities or gamble through the illegal gambling market. This measure is not expected to impact on family formation, stability or breakdown. HMRC customer experience is expected to remain broadly the same as this measure does not alter"}, {"file": "Gambling duty changes - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "how individuals interact with HMRC. ## Equalities impacts While this measure directly affects businesses, there may be indirect impacts to individuals who gamble if there is a negative change in betting odds. If a protected group is overrepresented in the gambling population, then it will be disproportionately impacted. There were no data available on the prevalence of different protected groups in the gambling population compared to the general UK adult population, therefore HMRC cannot make an assessment of whether there are disproportionate impacts on those with shared protected characteristics. However, from data on the likelihood of gambling, it is estimated that males are slightly more likely to gamble than females, though this varies with the type of gambling. Males are estimated to be more likely to participate in online gambling activities such as online betting, slots, and casino games, whereas females are estimated to be more likely to participate in online bingo. The age group estimated to be most likely to gamble was 55 to 64, whereas the age group least likely to gamble was 18 to 24. However, online gambling is estimated to be the most common among the 25 to 34 age group. In addition, young people from a White ethnic background were more likely to be identified as 'non-problem' gamblers than those from an ethnic minority background. There were no data available on the likelihood of gambling in other protected groups. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations This measure is expected overall to have a significant administrative impact on businesses providing gambling services in the UK. Abolition of Bingo Duty is expected to have an impact on 134 businesses that will no longer be required to pay Bingo Duty or submit Bingo Duty returns. There will be a negligible one-off cost to these businesses to familiarise themselves with the new rules. There are not expected to be any continuing costs but there will be significant continuing savings as businesses will no longer have to submit Bingo Duty returns. These administrative savings are estimated to be \u00a30.2 million per year. The increase in the Remote Gaming Duty rate and the introduction of a remote betting rate of 25% within General Betting Duty are expected to have an impact on around 160 business that provide remote betting to UK customers, 95 business that provide remote gaming to UK customers and 55 businesses that provide remote betting and gaming to UK customers. These businesses will see an increase to their duty bills. One-off costs include familiarisation with the changes and an initial updating of systems to reflect the new tax rate for Remote Gaming Duty and changes to systems to apply the new General Betting Duty rate for remote bets. It is not expected that there will be any continuing administrative costs. These increases will impact on the revenue of gaming and betting companies. How they respond will be a matter for these businesses. ## Estimated one-off administrative impact on businesses (\u00a3 million) | One-off impact |"}, {"file": "Gambling duty changes - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "\u00a3 million | |------------------|-------------| | Costs | Negligible | | Savings | - | ## Estimated continuing impact on administrative burden (\u00a3 million) | Continuing average annual impact | \u00a3 million | |--------------------------------------------|-------------| | Costs | Negligible | | Savings | 0.2 | | Net impact on annual administrative burden | -0.2 | Customer experience is expected to remain broadly the same as this measure doesn't alter how businesses interact with HMRC. There is expected to be no impact on civil society organisations. ## Operational impact (\u00a3 million) (HMRC or other) The changes to the rate of Remote Gaming Duty will have no operational impact on HMRC. Adding a new remote betting rate into General Betting Duty will require changes to some IT systems at an estimated cost to HMRC of up to \u00a31.9 million. Bingo Duty repeal will also require changes to IT systems at an estimated cost of up to \u00a3650,000. Operational resource impacts are still being assessed. ## Other impacts Other impacts have been considered and none have been identified ## Monitoring and evaluation Consideration will be given to monitoring or evaluating the expected exchequer impacts of the policy after 2 years of monitoring data have been analysed and collected ## Further advice If you have any questions about this change, contact John Waller on Telephone 03000 588063 or email john.c.waller@hmrc.gov.uk.

In particular, the measure makes a change to the calculation of taxable earnings (tax-EBITDA) in relation to capital expenditure on waste disposal site preparation and restoration, cemeteries and crematoria and flood and costal erosion risk management projects. ## Policy objective CIR restricts the ability of large businesses to reduce their taxable profits through excessive UK interest expense and other financing costs. It encourages alignment of the location of taxable profits with the location of economic activity and is consistent with the UK's more territorial approach to corporate taxation. This measure makes technical amendments to CIR legislation to ensure that the regime works as intended. ## Background to the measure This measure was announced at Budget 2025. As part of HMRC's engagement with customers and their advisers, it has been identified that under the CIR rules certain items of capital expenditure in respect of waste site preparation and restoration, and cemeteries and crematoria and flood and coastal erosion projects are not treated as intended. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date The amendments have effect for periods ending on or after 31 December 2021. ## Current law The CIR rules are in Part 10 of Taxation (International and Other Provisions) Act 2010 (TIOPA 2010). For CIR purposes, tax-EBITDA is defined in section 407 of TIOPA 2010. ## Proposed revisions Legislation will be introduced in Finance Bill 2025-26 to amend the calculation of tax-EBITDA in section 407 TIOPA 2010. In particular, the calculation of tax-EBITDA will be amended to exclude capital expenditure deducted by way of specific reliefs in respect of waste disposal site preparation and restoration, and cemeteries and crematoria and flood and coastal erosion risk management projects. ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3 million) | 2025 to 2026 | 2026 to 2027 | 2027 to 2028 | 2028 to 2029 | 2029 to 2030 | 2030"}, {"file": "Corporate Interest Restriction: relief for certain capital expenditure in calculation of taxable earnings (tax-EBITDA) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "to 2031 | |----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------| | Negligible | Negligible | Negligible | Negligible | Negligible | Negligible | This measure is expected to have a negligible impact on the Exchequer. ## Macroeconomic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. ## Impact on individuals, households and families There is no impact on individuals as this measure only affects businesses. ## Equalities impacts This measure only affects businesses; therefore, it is not anticipated that there will be disproportionate impacts on those in groups sharing protected characteristics. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations This measure will have a negligible impact on around 50 large businesses which are subject to CIR and which incur capital expenditure on waste site preparation or restoration, cemeteries and crematoria and flood and costal erosion projects. One-off costs could include familiarisation with the change, upskilling staff on the change, and updating software.

The new rule will deny tax relief for amounts arising from such arrangements that are attributable to a main purpose of securing a tax advantage. ## Policy objective This measure will support fairness in the tax system. This measure specifically addresses certain arrangements designed to secure a tax advantage, with a view to deterring them and securing receipts for the Exchequer that might otherwise be deferred through tax disputes. Securitisations form an important part of the UK's financial services landscape. This measure maintains support for securitisations. ## Background to the measure This measure was announced at Budget 2025. ## Securitisations In a securitisation, an 'originator' company transfers financial assets to the securitisation vehicle, which issues debt secured on the financial assets. The loan notes are split into tranches, offering varying risk and reward. For accounting purposes, in certain cases an originator may be required to continue to recognise the transferred assets. This may be referred to as nonderecognition, failed derecognition or continuing recognition. This can happen in a retained securitisation, being a securitisation where all the loan notes issued are beneficially owned by the originator's group. ## Arrangements seeking to secure a tax advantage An example of arrangements seeking to secure a tax advantage could involve an originator company selling some of the loan notes issued in a retained securitisation to an overseas subsidiary, with that sale funded by a low-interest loan from the originator to the overseas subsidiary. For accounting purposes, this could result in the recognition of a liability in the originator in connection with the original transfer of assets, and the originator recognising an expense in respect of this non-derecognition liability (which can be known as a failed derecognition liability or a continuing involvement liability). In such a case, HMRC considers that existing legislation"}, {"file": "Anti-avoidance rule in relation to non-derecognition liabilities - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "would also negate any UK tax advantage for such arrangements. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date The measure will have effect from 26 November 2025. ## Current law Chapter 1 of Part 20 of the Corporation Tax Act (CTA) 2009 deals with restriction of deductions for the purposes of Corporation Tax. ## Proposed revisions The new rule restricts deductions arising from arrangements where a main purpose of the arrangements is to secure a tax advantage. However, the rule will only be engaged where assets are transferred to a securitisation vehicle, these continue to be recognised for accounting purposes and, in connection with the transfer, a liability is recognised for accounting purposes. The rule will apply in relation to UK or non-UK securitisations. ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3 million) | 2025 to 2026 | 2026 to 2027 | 2027 to 2028 | 2028 to 2029 | 2029 to 2030 | 2030 to 2031 | |----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------| | +20 | +55 | +75 | +145 | +110 | +60 | These figures are set out in Table 4.1 of Budget 2025 and have been certified by the Office for Budget Responsibility.

This publication is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/capital-gains-tax-shareexchanges-and-reorganisations/capital-gains-tax-anti-avoidance-for-share-exchanges-andreorganisations ## Who is likely to be affected Individuals, trusts and companies involved in the exchange or reorganisation of a company's share capital. ## General description of the measure This measure makes changes to the capital gains avoidance rules that apply to share exchanges and company reconstructions. It amends the existing avoidance rules by ensuring that they apply to those persons who have entered into arrangements where the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of the arrangement is to secure a tax advantage that they would not ordinarily have been entitled to. ## Policy objective This measure will increase trust in the tax system by making the anti-avoidance rules that apply to the capital gains share exchange and reconstruction rules more effective. This supports the government's objective of a fair tax system. ## Background to the measure This measure was announced at Budget 2025. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date The measure will have effect in relation to an issue of shares or debentures made on or after 26 November 2025. Where a clearance application is received by HMRC before 26 November, the current legislation in section 137 Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act (TCGA) 1992 will apply where the shares and debentures are issued either: - within 60 days of announcement - if later, within 60 days of the decision under section 138(1) or (where relevant), of that under section138(4) TCGA 1992 ## Current law The capital gains share reorganisation rules, found at sections 127 to 139 in the TCGA 1992, broadly apply where a company's share capital is reorganised and are extended to where shares are issued to a person in exchange for shares in another company or its share capital is reconstructed. As these are usually 'paper for paper' transactions, where no cash has been paid, the reorganisation rules provide that there is no immediate charge to Capital Gains Tax (CGT) or Corporation Tax (CT) on shareholders. Instead, any gain is rolled over into the new shares. This avoids dry tax charges and ensures that tax is not an obstacle to such transactions, which are usually made for good commercial reasons. The reorganisation provisions are subject to avoidance rules"}, {"file": "Capital Gains Tax \u2014 anti-avoidance for share exchanges and reorganisations - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "found at s137(1) and 139(5) (and 103K(1)) TCGA 1992 and a clearance procedure at s138 TCGA 1992. ## Proposed revisions Legislation will be introduced in Finance Bill 2025-26 amending the antiavoidance provisions that apply to reorganisations, so that they now apply to those cases where a person has entered into arrangements where the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of those arrangements was to secure them a tax advantage. Where this is satisfied, the reorganisation provisions will not apply. This outcome will only apply to those persons who entered into such arrangements, it will not apply to persons who did not benefit from the avoidance put in place. The focus of the current rule is on the reason for, or purpose of the overall reorganisation. The proposed revisions mean that the rule will now better target those cases where, as part of a commercial exchange or company reconstruction, additional arrangements have been put in place to obtain a tax advantage. A transitional rule for clearance applications made under section 138 that are received by HMRC before 26 November 2025 will be introduced. ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3 million) | 2025 to 2026 | 2026 to 2027 | 2027 to 2028 | 2028 to 2029 | 2029 to 2030 | 2030 to 2031 | |----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------| | - | +20 | +20 | +20 | +20 | +20 | These figures are set out in table 4.1 of Budget 2025 and have been certified by the Office for Budget Responsibility. More details can be found in the policy costings document published alongside Budget 2025. ## Macroeconomic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. ## Impact on individuals, households and families The changes being made are primarily technical in nature, individuals will not be required to do anything differently. The main impact will be on those individuals who enter into avoidance schemes involving shares, often involving family companies, as the changes will make such avoidance planning more difficult. This measure is expected overall to have no impact on individuals' experience of dealing with HMRC. ## Equalities impacts The changes introduced by this measure will apply regardless of an individual's protected characteristics. The population impacted is expected to be a small subset of the CGT population. HMRC do not hold any data on the protected characteristics of those making use of these capital gains provisions and therefore cannot make an assessment of the impacts on those with protected characteristics. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations The measure will have a negligible administrative impact on those business that enter into avoidance schemes involving share or company reconstructions. One-off costs could include companies familiarising themselves with the change. There are not expected to be any further one-off or continuing costs.

It encourages alignment of the location of taxable profits with the location of economic activity, and is consistent with the UK's more territorial approach to corporate taxation. This measure simplifies administration of the regime for both businesses and HMRC. ## Background to the measure The administrative rules for CIR have given rise to issues. The lack of a valid reporting company appointment can invalidate any interest restriction returns that have been submitted and deny access to certain elements of the rules. On 28 April 2025, as part of tax update 2025 simplification, administration and reform, the government announced the establishment of a working group to consider opportunities to simplify and improve the administration rules for CIR and, in particular, reporting company appointments under the regime. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date The amendments have effect for periods ending on or after 31 March 2026 except for the following: - the ability of groups to make retrospective appointments will apply for periods ended on or after 31 March 2024 - the additional disclosure requirements to be included in interest restrictions returns are to be given effect by regulations ## Current law The CIR rules are in Part 10 of Taxation (International and Other Provisions) Act 2010 (TIOPA 2010). The rules governing the administration of CIR are at Schedule 7A to TIOPA 2010. The Corporate Interest Restriction (Electronic Communications) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/770) mandate electronic filing of certain documents. ## Proposed revisions Legislation will be introduced in Finance Bill 2025-26 to make amendments to Schedule 7A to TIOPA 2010.

This document aims to inform readers where the data used in the charts, tables and text come from and, where necessary, how they have been calculated. This document ensures that the Treasury meets the standards set out by the UK Statistics Authority to comply with the Statistics and Registration Act 2007 1 .. In particular, this document aims to meet the principles of the UK Statistics Authority's 'Code of Practice for Statistics' - with regard to Trustworthiness, Quality and Value, and which now includes standards for intelligent transparency 2 . It also aims to provide an example of the voluntary application of this code to outputs that are not official statistics. The main standards that this document addresses are in the Standards for the Public Use of Statistics, Data and Wider Analysis; that departments should ' publish statistics, data and wider analysis separately from any related policy and ministerial statements ' and ' where possible, draw on the latest and most reliable published official statistics. ' It does this by: - Distinguishing clearly between outturn data that are official statistics, and other data and estimates that are not official statistics 3 . Examples of estimates that are not official statistics include forecasts, management information and economic estimates. These may be calculated by HM Treasury or other government departments and are constructed using assumptions or judgements wherein the results of economic analyses have a material effect on the resulting estimate. - In the case of outturn data that are official statistics, by clearly referring to the source of the statistics and providing a link to the 1 Code of Practice for Statistics (Code of Practice for Statistics) UK Statistics Authority, 2025. 2 Regulator Guidance on Intelligence Transparency (Regulatory guidance on intelligent transparency -Office for Statistics Regulation), Office for Statistics Regulation, 2023. 3 The 'official statistics' label refers to a specified subset of the quantitative information produced by the government and its nominated agents.

For example, a tenant with a salary of \u00a325,000 this year (2025-26) would pay nearly \u00a31,200 more in tax than their landlord with the same income. The tenant would be liable to pay \u00a32,486 of income tax, as \u00a312,430 of their income would be over the Personal Allowance and subject to the 20% headline Income Tax rate for employment earnings. The tenant would also pay \u00a3994 of National Insurance Contributions at 8% rates on the \u00a312,430 over the Primary Threshold. A landlord with \u00a325,000 of income only from property income, would pay \u00a32,286 in Income Tax in 2025-26, as \u00a311,430 of their income over the Personal Allowance and \u00a31,000 Property Allowance, would be subject to the current 20% Income Tax rate.

Main points and summary ## 1.1 Enterprise Investment Scheme - in the tax year 2023 to 2024, 3,780 companies raised a total of \u00a31,575 million of funds under the EIS scheme. Funding has decreased by 20% from 2022 to 2023, the previous year, when 4,245 companies raised \u00a31,971 million - investment in 2023 to 2024 saw a further reduction compared to the previous year's, which was itself a decrease from the high levels of investment in 2021 to 2022 - around \u00a3309 million of investment was raised by 1,010 new EIS companies in 2023 to 2024 - in 2023 to 2024, companies from the Information and Communication sector accounted for \u00a3551 million of investment (35% of all EIS investment) - companies registered in London and the South East accounted for the largest proportion of investment, raising \u00a3997 million (63% of all EIS investment) in 2023 to 2024 ## 1.2 Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme - in 2023 to 2024, 2,290 companies raised a total of \u00a3242 million of funds under the SEIS scheme. Funding in 2023 to 2024 has increased by 51% from 2022 to 2023 when 1,835 companies raised \u00a3160 million. This is largely due to expansion of the limits of the scheme in April 2023 that allows companies to raise more investment and allows more companies to qualify - around 1,535 of the companies were raising funds under the SEIS scheme for the first time in 2023 to 2024, representing \u00a3181 million of investment - in 2023 to 2024, companies from the Information and Communication sector accounted for \u00a399 million (41% of all SEIS investment) - companies registered in London and the South East accounted for the largest proportion of investment, raising \u00a3156 million (65% of SEIS investment) in 2023 to 2024 ## 1.3 Social Investment Tax Relief - 2022 to 2023 was the last year that enterprises could raise investment through SITR due to the closure of the scheme for new investment from April 2023 ## 1.4 Advance assurance requests ## EIS - in 2024 to 2025, 3,090 AAR applications for EIS were received and 2,355 (76%) have been approved so far.

Introduction ## 2.1 About these statistics This is a National Statistics publication produced by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). It provides information on the number of companies raising funds, the number of subscriptions and the amounts raised through the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) and Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS). National Statistics are accredited official statistics (https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/accredited-official-statistics/). It also includes Official Statistics on social enterprises raising funds through the Social Investment Tax Relief (SITR) scheme for 2022 to 2023 and prior. The EIS and SEIS are 2 of 3 tax-based venture capital schemes that were active in the 2023 to 2024 tax year, the other being the Venture Capital Trust (VCT) scheme. The SITR scheme concluded in April 2023 and is no longer open to new investment. Investment figures are included in this publication for the purpose of final revisions of historical figures. Publications from Spring 2026 onwards will no longer include figures on investment through the SITR scheme. The current release includes the first estimates for 2023 to 2024. The figures for 2021 to 2022 and 2022 to 2023 include small revisions and minor updates, arising from the receipt of a small number of further EIS1 and SEIS1 forms for these years. Companies have a period of 3 years after shares are issued to submit a compliance statement. Figures from 2022 to 2023 onwards have been uplifted to take account of late returns submitted by companies. Thus, these figures should be treated as provisional and will be subject to revisions in future publications. The publication also provides information on the industrial and geographical breakdown of EIS and SEIS companies, the distribution of companies by the amounts of funds raised, and the distribution of investors by the size of their investment. Section 1 summarises the main statistical points; Sections 3, 4, and 5 presents an overview of the statistics and discusses recent trends. In Section 6, this release includes figures for advance assurance requests received by HMRC. As part of the qualifying process for seeking investment through the schemes, companies can provide a return to HMRC in advance of a share issue to check that it will meet the qualifying conditions for these conditions for these schemes. The statistical tables are included on the main publication page. The next release is planned to be in Spring 2026. People interested in this publication may also be interested in the National Statistics publication on Venture Capital Trusts (VCT) (https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/venture-capital-trusts-statistics). ## 3. Enterprise Investment Scheme"}, {"file": "Enterprise Investment Scheme, Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme and Social Investment Tax Relief statistics: 2025 - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "(EIS) ## 3.1 EIS: Number of EIS companies and amount of investment (Figure 1) The number of companies raising funds and the level of investment have shown similar trends since the EIS was introduced. In 2023 to 2024 the number of companies raising funds decreased to 3,780, raising a total of \u00a31,575 million. This is most likely a result of a sustained period of higher interest rates and some continued natural reduction following the high levels of investment in 2021 to 2022, that is reflective of the wider venture capital market in the UK. In addition, the increase to the limits of the SEIS scheme may have directed some funding away from EIS and into SEIS. Overall, there has been a steady increase in EIS use since 2010, due in part to a sustained period of historically low interest rates, increasing promotion and the involvement of fund managers. Additionally, users have responded to a series of legislative changes, notably in 2014, 2015 and 2018, introduced to ensure the focus is on investment in earlystage companies that have the intention to grow and develop in the longer term. In 2020 to 2021, there was a decrease in the number of companies raising funds under the EIS (10%), with the amount raised by EIS companies also dropping by 12% compared to the previous year. The Covid-19 pandemic is likely to have reduced investment through the first 3 quarters of tax year 2020 to 2021. However, funding rebounded in the last quarter of 2020 to 2021 with amounts being raised above pre-pandemic levels for the equivalent period. This trend continued into 2021 to 2022 where the strong rebound into investment saw both the number of companies raising funds and the total amount raised through the EIS exceeding the previous record limits set in 2017 to 2018 and 2019 to 2020. Following this record breaking year, the number of companies raising funds and the total amount raised has shown a reduction in both the 2022 to 2023 and 2023 to 2024 tax years. The amount of funds raised in 2023 to 2024 has dipped below the levels shown pre-pandemic. Figure 1: Number of companies raising funds and amount raised, 1993-94 to 2023-24 ## 3.2 EIS: New investment (Figure 2) The proportion of investment into new companies compared to that for companies raising further funding has declined since the peaks in 2014 to 2015. This coincides with the investment in renewable energy and the progressive exclusion of these activities from the EIS, as noted above. In 2018 to 2019, there was a large drop in funds raised by new companies with only 28% of funding being raised by companies using the EIS for the first time. This trend has continued with 20% of the total amount being raised by new EIS companies in 2023 to 2024. This is likely to be due to the introduction of the riskto-capital condition which places further restrictions on the qualification of investment under the EIS. In addition, with the"}, {"file": "Enterprise Investment Scheme, Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme and Social Investment Tax Relief statistics: 2025 - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "increase to the limits of the SEIS scheme, more newer companies may have qualified for, and favoured raising funds under, this scheme. These restrictions were introduced to ensure that investment under the EIS is genuinely at risk and is made with the intention of providing long-term growth and development of the company's trade. Those low-risk and limited growth investment arrangements targeted by the new condition typically involved the creation of new companies raising funds for the first time. A proportion of this investment was expected to be reinvested elsewhere and, with the new incentives to invest in knowledge intensive companies, this has resulted in increased investment in these companies. Figure 2: Amount of funds raised under the EIS by new companies and old companies, 1993-94 to 2023-24 ## 3.3 EIS: Industry Sector (Figure 3) In 2023 to 2024, companies from top 4 sectors (the Manufacturing, the Wholesale and Retail Trade, Repairs, the Information and Communication, the Professional, Scientific and Technical sectors) together accounted for around \u00a31,196 million of investment and made up 76% of all EIS Investment. This proportion is a slight increase compared with 2022 to 2023. Figure 3 compares the proportion of investment across sectors, by amount raised under the EIS between 2022 to 2023 and 2023 to 2024. The trends for the 2 years are similar, with an increase in the Financial and Insurance sector but a decrease in the Manufacturing sector. Figure 3: Comparison between amounts of funds raised under the EIS by different industry sectors, 2022-23 to 2023-24 The sector breakdowns in this section are based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 2007. ## 3.4 EIS: Size of investment per company (Figure 4) The distribution of the number of companies raising funds under the EIS by investment size differs from the distribution of amount of funds raised by size of investment. In 2023 to 2024, around 3% of EIS companies raised 23% of all investment (investments over \u00a32 million). It is likely that the risk-to-capital condition will have affected these higher investment categories in particular. Since 2012 to 2013 the annual limit on investment has been \u00a35 million. From 2018 to 2019 onwards this has been increased to \u00a310 million for KICs. Figure 4: Distribution of the proportion of funds raised under the EIS by investment band, 2023 to 2024 ## 3.5 EIS: Geographical region of company registration (Figure 5) The proportion of the amount of investment in companies with a registered office in London and the South East was 63% in 2023 to 2024. This proportion is similar to recent years. ## Figure 5: Distribution of the number of EIS companies and amount of investment by location, 2023 to 2024 ## 3.6 EIS: Investors claiming Income Tax relief under EIS (Figure 6) The number of investors claiming Income Tax relief on Self Assessment forms under the EIS has decreased, from 40,470 in tax year 2022 to 2023 to 35,150 in 2023 to 2024. The total investment on which tax relief was claimed under EIS"}, {"file": "Enterprise Investment Scheme, Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme and Social Investment Tax Relief statistics: 2025 - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "decreased overall (12%) in 2023 to 2024 compared with 2022 to 2023 and there was a decrease in the total number of investors (13%). This could be in part due to investors favouring SEIS investments following the investor limit expansion to benefit from the more generous tax relief rate. In 2018 to 2019, new limits were introduced for investments in KICs. These allow individuals to invest up to \u00a32 million in a year if they are investing in a KIC. There were 50 investments of between \u00a31 million and \u00a32 million in 2023 to 2024, contributing \u00a374 million of investment. With the higher limit available, investments of over \u00a3500,000 comprised 17% of the total amount of EIS investment raised on which claims were made in 2023 to 2024. Figure 6: Proportion of investors and amount of investment, by size of investment (investment on which Income Tax relief was claimed), 2023-24 Total figures provided on the amount of investment on which Income Tax relief was claimed are not directly comparable with the figures on the amount of investment reported by companies. Some investors may choose to offset the tax liability against the previous year. A small amount of relief would also be claimed through the PAYE system; this is assumed to relate to about 5% of total EIS investment. ## 4. Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme ## 4.1 SEIS: Number of SEIS companies and amount of ## investment (Figure 7) In 2023 to 2024, the number of companies raising investment under SEIS was 2,290, compared to 1,835 in the previous year. The amount raised by these companies increased by 51% to \u00a3242 million compared to \u00a3160 million in the previous year. The SEIS underwent a large expansion effective from April 2023 where several limits that restricted the number of companies that qualified for the SEIS increased. As part of the expansion, the limit on the amount of investment that companies can raise increased from \u00a3150,000 to \u00a3250,000. Combined, these limit relaxations are responsible for the sharp increase in the number of companies raising funds and the amount raised in 2023 to 2024. Figure 7: Number of companies raising funds and amount raised, 2012-13 to 2023-24 ## 4.2 SEIS: New investment (Figure 8) The number of new companies raising SEIS funds in tax year 2023 to 2024 increased by around 5% from the previous year, and the amount raised by these companies also increased by 29% which is consistent with the expansion of the SEIS company investment limit to \u00a3250,000. Figure 8: Amount of funds raised by new and old SEIS companies, 2012-13 to 2023-24 ## 4.3 SEIS: Industry sector (Figure 9) In 2023 to 2024, companies from just one sector (the Information and Communication) accounted for \u00a399 million of investment, which makes up 41% of the amount of SEIS investment received. The next 3 largest sectors (the Professional, Scientific and Technical, the Wholesale and Retail Trade, Repairs, the Manufacturing sectors) together account for 35% of investment.

In 2023 to 2024, around 45% of companies raised amounts over \u00a3100,000, compared to 41% in 2022 to 2023. The tax year 2023 to 2024 is the first year since the expansion of the limits of the SEIS scheme and companies are able to raise over \u00a3150,000. In 2023 to 2024, approximately 19% of companies raised over \u00a3150,000 and collectively they raised 38% of all investment through the scheme. ## Figure 10: The percentage distribution of funds raised under the SEIS by investment band, 2023-24 ## 4.5 SEIS: Geographical region of company registration (Figure 11) The largest proportion of funds raised under the SEIS were through companies with a registered office in London and the South East. In 2023 to 2024, these regions accounted for 65% of the total SEIS investment (Figure 11), which is similar to the previous year. ## Figure 11: The percentage distribution of the number of SEIS companies and amount of investment by location, 2023-24 ## 4.6 SEIS: Investors claiming Income Tax relief under SEIS (Figure 12) In 2023 to 2024, 10,145 investors claimed Income Tax relief on Self Assessment forms for the SEIS, compared to 8,245 investors in 2022 to 2023. The amount of relief claimed increased by 47%, which is broadly consistent with the 51% increase in funds raised by companies in 2023 to 2024. Most investors claiming the relief invested \u00a310,000 or less into qualifying SEIS companies (51%). Investments of over \u00a325,000 contributed 67% of the total amount of SEIS investment raised on which claims were made, which is broadly consistent with 2022 to 2023 (66%). As part of the April 2023 SEIS expansions, investors are now able to claim Income Tax relief on investments up to \u00a3200,000. This was previously limited to \u00a3100,000 in years prior to 2023 to 2024. In 2023 to 2024, approximately 3% of investors invested over \u00a3100,000 and collectively these investors represent approximately 22% of all investment on which Income Tax relief was claimed.

Social Investment Tax Relief ## 5.1 Number of social enterprises and amount of investment (Figure 13) 2022 to 2023 was the last year during which enterprises could raise investment through SITR due to the closure of the scheme for new investment in April 2023. Therefore no enterprises raised funds through the scheme in 2023 to 2024. For this reason, figures for SITR will no longer be reported as part of these National Statistics from 2026 onwards.

This publication is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/economic-crime-levychanges-to-bands-and-charges/economic-crime-levy-changes-to-bands-and-charges ## Who is likely to be affected Entities regulated for anti-money laundering (AML) purposes under the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds Regulation 2017 with an annual revenue of \u00a310.2 million or more. ## General description of the measure This measure makes three changes to the bands and rates of levy. The measure raises the charge for entities in the 'medium' band from \u00a310,000 to \u00a310,200. The measure will introduce a new band for entities with UK revenue between \u00a3500 million and \u00a31 billion with a charge of \u00a3500,000, splitting the current 'large' band. The measure raises the charge for entities in the 'very large' band from \u00a3500,000 to \u00a31,000,000. ## Policy objective The Economic Crime (Anti-Money Laundering) Levy was introduced to put in place long-term sustainable funding to tackle economic crime. This measure seeks to raise revenue to increase the funding available, whilst maintaining the objective that no business pays more than 0.1% of their revenue. ## Background to the measure This measure was announced at Budget 2025. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date The higher levy rate for entities regulated for AML purposes in the existing medium and very large bands, and in the new band for entities with UK Revenue between \u00a3500 million and \u00a31 billion, will first be charged in the financial year 2026 to 2027. The first payments following the rate changes will be due after the end of the Financial Year and before 30 September 2027. A person's UK Revenue is their revenue for the accounting period ending in the financial year. ## Current law Current law is contained in Part 3 of the Finance Act 2022 and The Economic Crime (Anti-Money Laundering) Levy Regulations 2022 (SI 2022/269). The levy charge for large entities is set out in section 54(2) of the Finance Act 2022. ## Proposed revisions Section 54(2) will be amended to introduce a new large (upper) band, and set the charge for this band as \u00a3500,000 in the case of an entity whose UK revenue for the relevant financial year is greater than \u00a3500 million but less than \u00a31 billion. The levy charges for medium entities will also be increased from"}, {"file": "Economic Crime Levy \u2014 Changes to Bands and Charges - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "\u00a310,000 to \u00a310,200, and the charge for very large entities will be increased from \u00a3500,000 to \u00a31,000,000. ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3 million) | 2025 to 2026 | 2026 to 2027 | 2027 to 2028 | 2028 to 2029 | 2029 to 2030 | 2030 to 2031 | |----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------| | nil | nil | nil | nil | nil | nil | The revenue raised from this measure has been offset by an equivalent amount of spending, leaving the overall impact as fiscally neutral. More details can be found in the policy costings document published alongside Budget 2025. ## Macroeconomic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. ## Impact on individuals, households and families This measure is not expected to impact on individuals as it only affects entities regulated for anti-money laundering (AML) purposes under the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds Regulation 2017. It is not expected that that the levy fees will be passed onto consumers. This measure is not expected to impact on family formation, stability or breakdown. ## Equalities impacts This measure only affects businesses, therefore it is not anticipated that there will be disproportionate impacts on those in groups sharing protected characteristics. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations An estimated 100 to 110 businesses which have an annual revenue between \u00a3500,000 and \u00a31 billion and are regulated for anti-money laundering (AML) purposes will now be required to pay an increased levy charge, rising from \u00a336,000 to \u00a3500,000 per annum. We expect administrative impacts on these businesses to be negligible, as no other aspects of the levy's calculation or operation are changing. One-off costs will include familiarisation with this change. There are not expected to be any further one-off or continuing costs. Customer experience is expected to remain broadly the same as this measure does not alter how businesses interact with HMRC. The same impacts may also apply to a small number of civil society organisations, where these organisations are regulated for AML purposes and fall into the medium, large (upper), or very large bands. ## Operational impact (\u00a3 million) (HMRC or other) The levy is being collected by the three statutory anti-money laundering supervisors: - HMRC - the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) - the Gambling Commission. Upfront costs to enable changes to IT systems to accommodate the new band system are expected to be up to \u00a31.2 million. These costs will be funded through revenue raised by the levy. The FCA and Gambling Commission already keep a proportion of the revenue they raise to reimburse the collection costs they accrue, and additional funding will be transferred to HMRC to fund the necessary IT work. ## Other impacts Other impacts have been considered and none have been identified. ## Monitoring and evaluation The government has committed to regular reporting on the operation of the levy each year and will continue to report on the impact of this change transparently. The government will undertake"}, {"file": "Economic Crime Levy \u2014 Changes to Bands and Charges - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "a review of the levy by the end of 2027, which may consider matters such as whether the levy: - is meeting its original policy objectives - should continue - should remain based on just the AML-regulated sector - is still being calculated and collected appropriately. ## Further advice If you have any questions about this change, contact the Economic Crime Strategy Unit email at economiccrimelevy@hmtreasury.gov.uk.

From: Published Department of Health and Social Care and The Rt Hon Wes Streeting MP 18 November 2025 Landmark strategy published on International Men's Day aims to tackle men's mental health challenges, improve physical health and reduce inequalities so men and boys get on and live longer, healthier lives As part of the strategy, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) will team up on the Premier League's Together Against Suicide initiative - and smash the stigma around mental health Men with prostate cancer will also benefit from improved care through the strategy, alongside \u00a33.6 million investment in suicide prevention projects targeting middle-aged men Men and boys across England will benefit from tailored healthcare and support as the government launches its first Men's Health Strategy. Launched on International Men's Day, the bold plan sets out comprehensive action to tackle the physical and mental health challenges men and boys face every day. Men can be less likely to seek help and more likely to su ff er in silence. This, combined with a higher propensity to smoke, drink, gamble and use drugs, means men's health is su ff ering, having a significant impact on families, workplaces and communities. This strategy will help give men and boys to get on and live longer, healthier lives. Suicide is one of the biggest killers of men under 50 and three-quarters of all suicides are men. That's why the government is investing \u00a33.6 million over the next 3 years in suicide prevention projects for middle-aged men in local communities across areas of England where men are at most risk of taking their own lives, including some of the most deprived areas in the country. This comes on top of expanding mental health teams in schools to ensure an additional 900,000 pupils have access to support by April 2026. The projects will break down barriers that middle-aged men face in seeking support, such as the stigma associated with seeking help and a lack of awareness of what is available and how to access it. Projects will be codesigned with experts and men with lived experience of mental health crises and suicidal thoughts. The focus on suicide prevention includes a partnership on the Premier League's Together Against Suicide initiative with the Samaritans, which looks to help tackle the stigma around men's mental health and embed health messaging into the matchday experience. Wes Streeting, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, said: - For too long, men's health has been overlooked. There has been a reluctance to accept that men su ff er specific inequalities and hardships. The fact is that life can be really di ffi cult for men in today's society. Men are dying nearly 4 years earlier than women, and suicide remains one of the leading causes"}, {"file": "Government unveils England's first ever\u00a0Men's Health Strategy - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "of death for men under 50. ' - This strategy marks a turning point - the first time we're taking comprehensive, co-ordinated action to address the health challenges facing men and boys. ' - Teaming up with the Premier League will harness the power of football to break down barriers and reach millions of men who might never walk through a GP's door. ' - We know men are less likely to come forward for healthcare. From partnering with the premier league to rolling out health support in the workplace - we're meeting men where they are and giving them the support they need to live longer, healthier lives.' ' Together Against Suicide was launched by the Premier League in September 2025 and provides matchday support for fans in stadiums, initially through 11 pilot clubs, as well as providing an online hub of information for fans and followers watching from home. This partnership will enhance that support by ensuring clubs are working closely with their local NHS trusts, increasing their knowledge and training on suicide prevention, as well as actively promoting existing mental health and suicide prevention support such as NHS Talking Therapies and Every Mind Matters. Premier League Chief Executive, Richard Masters, said: - Unfortunately, suicide is an issue that a ff ects people of all ages and backgrounds. Football has the power to break down stigma and connect fans with support that can make a real di ff erence. Through the Premier League's Together Against Suicide initiative, we are working with clubs and partners to reduce the stigma around suicide and provide ongoing support for people who need it most. ' - This means providing matchday services through clubs, creating an online hub with professional help and promoting conversations that can help change lives. Whether it's speaking to family and friends, to experts on a matchday or contacting the Samaritans' free support line, fans should know help is always within reach. ' We are pleased to be supporting the government's Men's Health Strategy. By joining forces, we can make a positive di ff erence - and we urge fans to look after themselves and those they care about.' ' Men face a range of barriers in accessing healthcare services, such as stigma and services that are not responsive to men's needs - we want men to overcome these issues and stop too many cases of preventable deaths. This strategy puts men's health front and centre, addressing the challenges men face and designing solutions with men, for men. Men with prostate cancer will also benefit from improved care through the strategy, including the development of home prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing for those being monitored for the disease. From 2027, subject to clinical approval, men diagnosed with prostate cancer that is being actively monitored or treated will be able to order and complete PSA blood tests at home, or book an in-person blood test locally through the NHS App. Other commitments in the Men's Health Strategy include: - investing"}, {"file": "Government unveils England's first ever\u00a0Men's Health Strategy - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "\u00a33 million into community-based men's health programmes, designed to reach those most at risk and least likely to engage with - traditional services men's health training for healthcare professionals through new e-learning modules and resources - workplace health pilots with EDF Energy through the Keep Britain Working Vanguard Programme to support male workers in male-dominated industries - enhanced lung disease support for former miners, with increased investment in the Respiratory Pathways Transformation Fund in areas with significant former mining communities funding research to help prevent, diagnose, treat and manage the major - male killers and causes of unhealthy life years in men a \u00a3200,000 trial of new brief interventions to target the rise in cocaine and alcohol-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths, particularly among older men The Men's Health Strategy supports the government's ambition to halve the gap in healthy life expectancy between the richest and poorest regions, while increasing it for everyone. It tackles unhealthy behaviours, loneliness and social isolation, and harmful societal norms that prevent men seeking help, focusing on places that men frequent such as workplaces and sports clubs to drive change. Professor Lucy Chappell, Chief Scientific Adviser at DHSC and Chief Executive O ffi cer of the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), said: - We know that men are disproportionately a ff ected by certain conditions, such as some forms of cancer and addiction, and even rates of suicide. This strategy provides a critical focus for the NIHR's research e ff orts, ensuring we target research to the health and care needs that cause the greatest burden on men's lives. ' - Michelle Terry, Chief Executive O ffi cer, Movember, said: The NIHR is committed to ensuring that research is inclusive and representative, and we are uniquely positioned to help address health inequalities, fund and deliver new research that reaches all men.' ' - Today marks a historic day for men's health in the UK. This bold strategy has strong foundations which can be built on and delivered by government, charities, health professionals, men and their communities working together. ' - We now need rapid progress and delivery of the action plan to ensure this strategy creates real, measurable change. The UK has the opportunity not just to turn the tide on men's health, but to become a global leader in men's health policy, and a strong plan deserves backing.' ' Julie Bentley, Chief Executive O ffi cer, Samaritans, said: - Three-quarters of suicides are by men so the time for action is now and today's announcement is a great start. It's hugely positive to see this new strategy, the first of its kind, making suicide prevention a core focus. ' ' Suicide isn't inevitable but preventing it takes teamwork and Samaritans' Together Against Suicide initiative with the Premier League is a powerful partnership aimed at reaching men where they are. - Chiara De Biase, Director of Health Services, Equity and Improvement at We welcome the government's recognition of the impact of suicide on"}, {"file": "Government unveils England's first ever\u00a0Men's Health Strategy - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "men and the inclusion of suicide in the Men's Health Strategy is an important step in us together tackling the tragic reality that suicide is the biggest killer of men under 50.' ' Prostate Cancer UK, said: - We're pleased to see the government prioritising improvement of men's experience of prostate cancer care as part of the Men's Health Strategy. Vital changes like giving men more control over their health and providing them with personalised support is long overdue, and we're committed to working with the government and the NHS to turn these words into actions that have a life changing impact for men. We look forward to seeing the details on these proposed changes. ' - The earlier you find prostate cancer, the easier it is to treat, so any men concerned can head to the Prostate Cancer UK's online 'risk checker' to find out if they're at risk of prostate cancer and what they can do about it.' ' This first ever Men's Health Strategy is a crucial first step, laying the foundation from which we can learn, change and improve the approach. It is not just a plan, it is a call to action to create a society where: men and boys are supported to live longer, healthier and happier lives stigma is replaced by understanding - every man knows that his health matters A stakeholder group will oversee implementation of the strategy, with the government publishing a one year report to ensure accountability. Musician and Movember ambassador, Professor Green (Stephen Manderson), said: - Like too many families, mine has lived through the unthinkable impact of male suicide. Today marks the start of government working with experts to tackle that. ' - The challenges facing men go far beyond simply not going to the doctor. We need a joined-up approach across government to look at how we raise boys, the role of fathers, the influence of culture and schools, and how health services meet men where they are. That's how we build communities of healthier men.' ' Lord Foster of Bath, Chair of Action on Gambling, said: - The first ever Men's Health Strategy is an important milestone, and the fact that it correctly identifies gambling as a significant risk is particularly welcome. Under the leadership of the Department of Health [and Social Care], progress in tackling preventable health issues that disproportionately impact men, such as problem gambling, will at last be possible.' ' - Greg Fell, President of the Association of Directors of Public Health, said: This new strategy recognises that there is no one solution and sets out sensible and achievable goals that everyone involved in improving men's ' health and wellbeing can work towards. - We are pleased to see this new strategy emphasises preventing the many avoidable illnesses and diseases - including a number of cancers and respiratory and mental health conditions - that are driven by smoking, drinking and gambling. The focus on improving wellbeing is also welcome.

For this strategy to be truly e ff ective, the government must build on the positive changes that are already being made, not just in the short term but for generations of boys and men to come.' ' - Dr Charmaine Gri ffi ths, Chief Executive at the British Heart Foundation, said: Cardiovascular disease is one of the UK's biggest killers of men, claiming the lives of more than one in 4 of our brothers, fathers, uncles and sons. Today's strategy for England is a vital step forward in tackling this major health challenge. ' - CVD doesn't a ff ect all men equally, so we fully back ambitions to improve the health and wellbeing of all men and boys by meeting them where they are and increasing the support available for them in their local community. ' - Mark Brooks OBE, Director of Policy, Centre for Policy Research on Men and We are pleased to see government recognise the important role environmental and social influences play in men's health, and how addressing these can help protect more men from developing CVD. For example, investing in support to quit smoking will enable more men and boys to live long lives in good heart health for generations to come.' ' Boys, said: The Men's Health Strategy is game changing. Alongside focusing on improving health outcomes for men and boys, it puts men's health firmly on the map. This is because, for the first-ever time, it is recognised as a distinct and vital area of public policy, professional practice and public health. The complementary focus on health research is very welcome too. The more evidence and understanding we have of what works will be a huge leap forward. This not only benefits men and boys themselves, it benefits their families, the community and the economy.' ' James Grimes, Director of Chapter One, Gambling with Lives, said: - The release of this strategy is very welcome, especially in its recognition ' - of the health harms caused by gambling - harms felt by countless men across the country. - As someone who has struggled with mental health issues driven by gambling, I wholeheartedly support the government's focus on prevention and hope to see continued action on the commercial factors that shape our health.' ' - Peter Baker, Chief Executive, Global Action on Men's Health, said: It's great that England has joined the handful of countries around the world with national men's health strategies. We know that a malefocused, co-ordinated and system-wide approach can accelerate the changes that are urgently needed to improve men's unnecessarily poor outcomes and we hope that other governments will now soon follow England's excellent example.'

' We know that men face unique barriers to care, including lower engagement with preventive services, cultural stigmas and distrust ' associated with seeking help. Tailored interventions such as mental health outreach and workplace health initiatives are essential to overcoming these issues. Local councils have been working in partnership with community groups and grassroots organisations to e ff ectively address men's health in this way and they remain ideally placed to lead and foster this working. - Dr John Chisholm CBE, Chair of the Men's Health Forum, said: The silent health crisis among men is a pressing issue for society, but with sustained attention and collective action, we can ensure that more men receive the support they need to lead longer, happier and healthier lives.' ' ' I welcome today's publication of the Men's Health Strategy for England and the personal commitment of the Secretary of State to that strategy. The Men's Health Forum has been campaigning and advocating for a national strategy for over a decade, working with other organisations. - A strategic, gendered approach to healthcare should improve access and outcomes and address inequalities. It is particularly welcome that organisations committed to improving the health of men and boys will be involved in a stakeholder group helping to implement the strategy, and that there is a commitment to evaluate progress in a year's time. It is also encouraging that the strategy addresses societal, structural and systemic issues that hamper the health and wellbeing of men and boys.' ' Caroline Ellis, Chief Executive O said: ' The UK Men's Sheds Association (UKMSA) welcomes the launch of England's first-ever Men's Health Strategy. - It is a landmark moment that recognises the importance of communitybased and peer-led spaces in supporting men's health and wellbeing. We look forward to working with local communities, partners and policymakers to turn the strategy into positive outcomes for men and boys across the country.' ' - General Secretary to the National Union of Mineworkers, Chris Kitchen, said: We welcome the Men's Health Strategy and particularly the announcement of extra support for mineworkers with respiratory conditions.

methodologies underlying costings for tax and annually managed expenditure (AME) policy decisions announced since Spring Statement 2025, where those policies have a fiscally significant impact on the public finances. These costings were all submitted to the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) for their certification. This document presents detailed information on the main data and assumptions underpinning the costing of policies in the Budget. Each note sets out a description of the measure, the base, the methodology for the costing (including relevant adjustments for behavioural responses) and highlights main areas of additional uncertainty, beyond those inherent in the OBR's forecast. For certain measures -primarily large or novel measures - an expanded format, setting out the costing in more detail, has been applied. All costings are presented on a National Accounts basis. The OBR set out the approach they have taken to scrutiny and certification of the costings, and highlights areas of particular uncertainty in their Economic and Fiscal Outlook (EFO). The EFO also sets out how the indirect effects of Budget measures have been accounted for; this document focuses only on the direct fiscal impact of Budget measures. Measures that are certified by the OBR as below the 'negligible threshold' in every year are not considered in this document. This threshold has been increased to \u00a310m at this event, to reflect inflation since the introduction of the threshold. Annex A sets out the indexation assumptions included in the public finances forecast baseline, including all pre-announcements. ## Policy Costings ## Renewables Obligation: Fund 75% of the domestic share of the Renewables Obligation via the Exchequer over the Spending Review period ## Measure description This policy funds a part of the cost of the Renewables Obligation (RO) via the Exchequer. The RO is a scheme for funding renewable electricity generation. It is closed to new entrants, but payments to existing generators are funded through a hypothecated levy on electricity bills. This measure funds 75 per cent of the proportion of the scheme which is due to be levied on domestic electricity bills in 2026/27, 2027/28, and 2028/29. DESNZ will reimburse suppliers for a proportion of the RO obligation which will be passed on to domestic customers through lower electricity prices. This measure will be effective from 1 April 2026. ## The cost base The cost base is the OBR's"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "baseline revenue forecast for the Renewables Obligation. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying to the above forecast the 75 per cent proportion that is now funded and the share of the cost of the RO scheme that is projected to be levied on households (approximately 41 per cent). This has been estimated using historic data and energy system models by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero. The costing does not make a behavioural adjustment. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | -2,580m | -2,100m | -2,195m | +0m | +0m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainty in this costing relate to the future size of the cost base. ## Warm Homes Plan: Expand the Warm Home Discount Scheme ## Measure description The Warm Home Discount scheme is a \u00a3150 annual, automatically applied, electricity bill rebate. This policy expanded eligibility to all households on qualifying means-tested benefits. This measure has been effective since October 2025. ## The tax base The tax base for this measure is household energy bills. The Department for Work and Pensions provides figures on the number of individuals receiving qualifying benefits. This is used to estimate the anticipated spend of the measure based on the expected size of the eligible population. Ofgem sets the price cap according to this, allowing participating energy suppliers to recover the receipts to fund the rebates. ## Costing The costing is estimated by subtracting the pre-measure cost from the postmeasure cost. No behavioural adjustment is applied. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) Below is the net impact of the measure expansion. The gross impact of the measure is around \u00a3600 million a year. The expenditure and receipts should net off each year and therefore this measure is fiscally neutral. | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |-------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +0m | +0m | +0m | +0m | +0m | | o/w additional revenue | +590m | +600m | +615m | +625m | +640m | +640m | | o/w additional spending | -590m | -600m | -615m | -625m | -640m | -640m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainty is the number of households that will be receiving qualifying means-tested benefits, and the number of individuals who are named on each household electricity account. ## Fuel Duty: Cancel uprating for 2026-27; extend the 5p cut in rates to 31 August 2026, then increase by 1p from 1 September 2026, 2p from 1 December 2026, and 2p from 1 March 2027 ## Measure description This measure extends the temporary 5 pence per litre (ppl) cut in fuel duty, which was first implemented on 23 March 2022, from 23 March 2026 to 31 August 2026 on rates for heavy oil (diesel and kerosene), unleaded petrol, and light oil, with a proportionate percentage cut (equivalent to 5ppl from the main fuel"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "duty rate of 57.95ppl) in other lower rates and the rates for rebated fuels where practical. Rates will then gradually return to early 2022 levels in three stages: for main rates, by 1p on 1 September 2026, 2p on 1 December 2026, and 2p on 1 March 2027, returning to 57.95 pence per litre at that point. The planned increase in line with inflation for 2026/27 is also cancelled. From 1 April 2027, fuel duty rates will be uprated annually in line with the Retail Price Index. This measure will be effective from 23 March 2026. ## The tax base The tax base is every litre of taxable fuel made available for use in the UK. Projected volumes are taken from the fuel duty forecasting model. ## Costing The costing is calculated by taking the forecast baseline and applying the difference in the forecast and policy duty rates. The static costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure tax regimes to the tax base. Behavioural responses are accounted for by measuring changes in consumption in response to changes in pump prices, with separate elasticities for petrol and diesel reflecting short and long-run effects. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | -45m | -2,370m | -855m | -855m | -850m | -840m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the tax base and the behavioural response. ## Universal Credit Child Element: Remove the two child limit from April 2026, taking 450,000 children out of poverty ## Measure description The measure will remove the limit on the number of children a household on Universal Credit can claim the child element for. ## Cost base and data The cost base is the Universal Credit expenditure forecast before removal of the two-child limit. The main data sources are the Family Resources Survey (FRS) on which DWP' s Policy Simulation Model (PSM) based, the UC forecasts and the OBR's economic assumptions, which are both incorporated into the model. UC administrative data is also used to account for exceptions to the current policy, which are not modelled in the PSM. ## Static costing The static Exchequer impact is calculated by comparing the baseline Universal Credit expenditure forecast before the policy change to expenditure after removal of the two-child limit for households with third and subsequent children born after April 2017. ## Static Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | -2,055m | -2,250m | -2,445m | -2,715m | -2,850m | ## Post-behavioural costing The costing includes one key behavioural response, which is set out below: | Behaviour | Description | |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Some eligible households may begin claiming due to the higher entitlement or increased publicity | Estimated using the Policy Simulation Model (PSM) and Family Resources Survey data.

This estimate is uncertain and reflects judgement as to how people will respond to the change. | The costing assumes no significant impacts assumed for other benefits. The PSM modelling accounts for interactions between the policy and the benefit cap. After applying the behavioural responses above, this results in the following post-behavioural costing ## Post-behavioural Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | -2,365m | -2,590m | -2,815m | -3,095m | -3,235m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing are on behavioural assumptions. The estimate for increased take-up is highly uncertain, and the actual response may differ. Costs are also sensitive to wider demographic and macroeconomic trends. ## Universal Credit: Extend the \u00a32,500 surplus earnings threshold for one year from 6 April 2026 ## Measure description The measure maintains the surplus earnings threshold at \u00a32,500 for Universal Credit claimants for a further year until April 2027. This measure will be effective from 6 April 2026. ## The cost base The cost base is estimated using DWP's Policy Simulation Model, which uses benefit expenditure forecasts and the OBR's forecast of economic determinants. ## Costing The costing is produced by comparing the cost base described above to a pre-measure forecast baseline. No behavioural effects have been taken into account as these are judged to be negligible. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | -145m | +0m | +0m | +0m | +0m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in the costing relate to the earning patterns of claimants and the number of claimants who may have more pay days than usual during an assessment period. ## Child Benefit: Exempt 16 -19-year-olds with an illness or disability from the 12-hour weekly rule and equalise the treatment of non-standard educational settings from 1 September 2025 ## Measure description This measure extends entitlement to Child Benefit for (i) parents or carers of young people aged 16-19 with an illness or disability who are studying for 12 hours or fewer per week, and (ii) parents of 16 -19-year-olds who are educated full-time outside school or college where this began after the age of 16. This measure is effective from September 2025. ## The cost base The cost base consists of (i) 16-19 year olds with an illness or disability and/or (ii) studying outside school and college, where this began after the age of 16, who will be brought into eligibility for Child Benefit payments. The cost base is estimated using Labour Force Survey and administrative data and is grown over the forecast horizon using the OBR's Autumn 2025 economic determinants. ## Costing The costing is calculated by multiplying the number of young people brought into eligibility for Child Benefit payments"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "by the relevant Child Benefit rates. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | -15m | -25m | -25m | -25m | -25m | -25m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainty in this costing relates to how accurately the Labour Force Survey estimates the size of the newly eligible population. ## Carer's Allowance Review: Reassess overpayments from 2015 to 2025 caused by incorrect operational guidance ## Measure description This measure is for an exercise to write off or reimburse Carer's Allowance overpayments between 2015 and 2025 which were found to be wrongly accrued due to incorrect application of DWP operational guidance on how to average fluctuating earnings. This measure will be effective from October 2026. ## The cost base The cost base for this measure is DWP administrative data on Carer's Allowance overpayments. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the results of a review of a random sample of Carer's Allowance overpayments to determine whether their fluctuating earnings were averaged incorrectly and then applying the findings to the caseload in scope. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | -20m | -35m | -20m | +0m | +0m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainty in this costing is the availability of information on DWP systems to identify the volume of people impacted by the incorrect guidance. ## Housing Benefit: Reduce the financial cliff edge for claimants in supported housing and temporary accommodation from Autumn 2026 ## Measure description DWP is introducing new income disregards, to fix the interaction between Housing Benefit and Universal Credit, so that claimants will not be subject to reductions in their income for working more hours. This will help ensure the welfare system does not disincentivise work. This measure will be effective from Autumn 2026. ## The cost base The cost base is estimated using total Housing Benefit expenditure forecasts and caseloads, for working-age claimants in supported housing and temporary accommodation who are in scope for this measure. ## Costing The costing is based on those on the Housing Benefit taper who are estimated to see an increase in the amount of Housing Benefit they receive, as a result of the new income disregards. No behavioural effects have been taken into account because of the limitations in accurately quantifying the labour market response. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | -10m | -20m | -25m | -25m | -25m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainty in this costing is the implementation start date, as local authorities will be required to make changes to their IT systems to deliver the policy. ## DWP Fraud and Error: Extend Targeted Case Review of Universal Credit to 2030-31 ## Measure description This"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "measure extends DWP's Targeted Case Review of incorrect Universal Credit claims to 2031. This is currently due to expire in April 2030 but will be extended until April 2031. ## The cost base The cost base is estimated using outturn data for the current performance of Targeted Case Review and forecasted levels of fraud and error and caseload in Universal Credit. ## Costing The costing is estimated by forecasting the volume of reviews undertaken and the value of incorrectness found. This includes the detection of historic overpayments and savings associated with the prevention of the future duration of that overpayment. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +0m | +0m | +0m | +0m | +1,265m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the performance of the Targeted Case Review workforce and the size of the average overpayments it detects. ## DWP Fraud and Error: Improve accuracy in Pension Credit claims from April 2026 ## Measure description This measure introduces reviews of Pension Credit claims that are at risk of being incorrect. This measure will be effective from April 2026 to April 2029. ## The cost base The cost base is estimated using staffing profiles and productivity levels of a dedicated Pension Credit review team, combined with the forecast levels of fraud and error. ## Costing The costing is estimated by combining the historic overpayments that will be identified through the service with the future overpayments that will be prevented, based on assumptions about how long the overpayment would have continued to exist if it had not been found. The value of underpayments that will be identified through the service is discounted. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +15m | +85m | +135m | +75m | +60m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the performance of the review workforce and the size of the average overpayments it detects. ## Health and Disability Benefits: Improve operations by increasing face-to-face assessments, increasing WCA reassessment capability, and PIP award review changes, starting from April 2026 ## Measure description This measure will make operational improvements to health assessments to ensure people receive the right health or disability benefit and the system is sustainable. These operational changes include increasing Work Capability Assessment (WCA) reassessment capacity and changing the frequency of Personal Independence Payment (PIP) award reviews so that DWP can complete award reviews on time, reducing the number of people who are called to a PIP assessment when their function has not changed, and allowing providers to redirect resource to WCA re-assessments. It will also increase the number of face-to-face health assessments conducted across both PIP and the WCA.

It also removes the Insurance Premium Tax (IPT) relief for vehicles leased through such schemes. Tax changes will not apply to vehicles designed for, or substantially and permanently adapted for, wheelchair or stretcher users. This measure is implemented for new leases from 1 July 2026. ## Tax base and data The tax base is an estimate of lease payments to Motability, and the payments of insurance premiums for the Motability scheme. The tax base is projected forward using the OBR's economic forecast and forecasts of Personal Independence Payment, Disability Living Allowance, and Motability's insurance premium rates. The main data used in this costing is the value of lease rentals and insurance premiums from financial information relating to Motability Operations, as well as the forecast data referred to above. The overall estimate of the tax base (i.e. the value of lease payments to Motability, excluding wheelchair accessible vehicles and certain adapted cars) in 2026-27 is around \u00a33.5 billion. ## Static costing The static Exchequer impact is calculated by applying the pre- and postmeasure tax regimes to the tax base described above for leases commencing after the start date. The revenue from IPT is phased in as new leases commence, reaching a steady state three years after the introduction of the policy. This results in the following static costing: ## Static Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) |"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "| 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +110m | +200m | +265m | +325m | +355m | ## Post-behavioural costing The costing includes two key behavioural responses, which are set out below: | Behaviour | Description | |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Motability will absorb part of the tax cost through cost and service changes, passing the remainder to leases via higher top- up payments on leases. | The costing assumes that 36% of the static yield is passed on as higher top-up payments on leases. The pass-through rate of 36% is based on the proportion of the tax cost expected to be absorbed by the Motability operator through cost and service changes, the remainder being passed to lease prices. This is based on information provided by Motability. The pass-through rate of 36% is an average, with some leases still having no top-up payments. | | Some taxpayers may reduce their expenditure on a vehicle lease or withdraw from the scheme entirely. | The costing assumes an elasticity of demand of -1.75.

Rather than a wholescale merger of these benefits from 2028/29, the government is starting with a sub-set of customers from Autumn 2026, ensuring it is operationalised as intended. It will then be rolled out to all Pension Credit and Housing Benefit recipients. ## The cost base The cost base is estimated using benefit caseload and expenditure forecasts from the DWP publication 'Income -related benefits: estimates of takeup' , for those of pension age who are entitled to, but not yet recipients of, Housing Benefit or Pension Credit. ## Costing The costing is estimated by reprofiling the annual costs of the previous Housing Benefit and Pension Credit merger delivery model in the baseline forecast, to reflect the updated timelines. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | -5m | -10m | +105m | +225m | +265m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the behavioural response. ## National Insurance: Remove access"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "to Class 2 National Insurance contributions (NICs) and increase the initial residency and contributions history requirements for Class 3 NICs for individuals abroad from 6 April 2026 ## Measure description This measure will remove access to pay voluntary Class 2 NICs abroad and increase the initial residency or contributions requirement to pay voluntary NICs outside of the UK from 3 to 10 years. This measure will be effective from 6 April 2026. ## The cost base The cost base is derived from DWP's Autumn 2025 forecast of State Pension expenditure. The tax base is those paying Class 2 and Class 3 NICs abroad, estimated from HMRC data. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure benefit regimes to the cost and tax base described above. The tax cost is estimated to be negligible. The yield arises from the forecasted State Pension expenditure savings. Removing access to Class 2 NICs for all individuals abroad, and access to Class 3 NICs for some individuals abroad means affected individuals will not continue to build State Pension entitlement, leading to savings in pension spending (AME). Some of the Class 2 NICs paying population are assumed to switch to purchase Class 3 NICs. There are no behavioural effects anticipated for increasing the upfront residency requirements to 10 years. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | -5m | +5m | +10m | +10m | +15m | ## Areas of uncertainty The key uncertainty of this measure concerns the behavioural response to the voluntary Class 2 NICs abroad being abolished, and the numbers who will continue to purchase the more expensive Class 3. ## Business Rates: Introduce a three-year Transitional Relief scheme, partially funded by a 1p Transitional Relief Supplement in 2026/27 ## Measure description This measure caps bill increases for eligible properties each year as a result of increasing rateable values at the 2026 business rates revaluation. This measure will be effective from 1 April 2026 and run until 31 March 2029. The Transitional Relief Supplement introduces a 1p supplement on top of the multipliers, paid for by ratepayers not receiving Transitional Relief. This will apply for one year from 1 April 2026 until 31 March 2027. ## The cost base The cost base for Transitional Relief consists of all non-domestic properties seeing an increase in business rates liabilities greater than the transitional relief caps, multiplied by the relevant multiplier for relevant years. The cost base for the Transitional Relief Supplement is all existing nondomestic properties that do not receive Transitional Relief, multiplied by 1p. ## Costing The static costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure tax regimes to the tax base described above. The static cost is adjusted to reflect interactions with other Business Rates measures, Corporation Tax and Income Tax for the self-employed.

To be eligible, businesses must be losing part or all of their Small Business Rates Relief, Rural Rates Relief, or Retail, Hospitality and Leisure (RHL) relief. This measure will be effective from 1 April 2026 and runs until 31 March 2029. In addition, those currently receiving the 2023 Supporting Small Business Relief scheme will be eligible for the 2026 Supporting Small Business Scheme until 31 March 2027. This measure will be effective from 1 April 2026. ## The tax base The tax base consists of estimates of the rateable value of properties in England losing eligibility for or seeing reductions in Small Business Rates Relief, Rural Rate Relief, or RHL relief multiplied by the relevant business rates multiplier for relevant years. It also consists of the rateable value of properties still in receipt of the 2023 Supporting Small Business scheme in 2025/26, multiplied by the relevant multiplier for 2026/27. ## Costing The static costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure tax regimes to the tax base described above. The static cost is adjusted to reflect that business rates are deductible for Corporation Tax for companies and Income Tax for the self-employed, and that business rates are devolved to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The costing includes no adjustments for behavioural effects. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +25m | -1,180m | -500m | -305m | +5m | +0m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the tax base and the impacts of appeals against property valuations on rateable values. ## Business Rates: Introduce two new lower multipliers for eligible retail, hospitality and leisure properties funded by a new high-value multiplier from 1 April 2026 ## Measure description This measure introduces two new business rates multipliers for eligible retail, hospitality and leisure (RHL) properties in England with rateable values below \u00a3500,000, 5p below the national small business and standard multipliers. To fund this sustainably, a new high-value multiplier is being introduced on properties in England with rateable values of \u00a3500,000 and above, 2.8p above the national standard multiplier. This measure will be effective from 1 April 2026. ## The tax base The tax"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "base consists of the total rateable values of all RHL properties that are eligible for the new lower multipliers with rateable values below \u00a3500,000 and all non-domestic properties in England with rateable values of \u00a3500,000 and above, multiplied by the business rates multiplier for relevant years. Existing reliefs - Small Business Rates Relief, Rural Rate Relief, Empty Property Relief and Charitable Rates Relief - reduce the size of this base. ## Costing The static costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure tax regimes to the tax base described above, and includes up to \u00a370m estimated funding for local authorities to administer the business rates announcements. Further adjustments include interactions with other measures, Corporation Tax and Income Tax, and behavioural effects. The costing also accounts for a decrease in the cost of other reliefs compared to the forecast. These adjustments mean that the yield of the high value multiplier does not match the cost of the RHL multipliers. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025- 26 | 2026- 27 | 2027- 28 | 2028- 29 | 2029- 30 | 2030- 31 | |---------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------| | RHL multipliers | +10m | -965m | -860m | -865m | -865m | -865m | | High-value multiplier | -5m | +805m | +795m | +795m | +795m | +795m | | Small business rates relief and rural rate relief interaction | -5m | +110m | +105m | +105m | +105m | +105m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the tax base, the impacts of appeals against property valuations on rateable values, and the impact of behavioural responses. ## Enterprise Management Incentives (EMI): Increase eligibility to allow scale-ups, as well as start-ups, to access the scheme from 6 April 2026 ## Measure description This measure expands eligibility for eligible companies under the Enterprise Management Incentives (EMI) scheme by increasing the employee limit from 250 to 500, the gross assets threshold from \u00a330 million to \u00a3120 million, and the company option cap from \u00a33 million to \u00a36 million, with the maximum holding period extended from 10 years to 15 years. This measure will be effective from 6 April 2026. ## The tax base The tax base for this measure comprises employees and companies newly participating in the EMI scheme, and those currently participating which will grow beyond the existing limits. This includes: - Employees benefiting from EMI share options through Income Tax and National Insurance reliefs; - Employees claiming Capital Gains Tax relief, following disposal of new EMI shares under qualifying conditions; and - Employers claiming relief from Corporation Tax and employer National Insurance; The tax base is grown over the forecast horizon using projections based on the historic trend growth in the EMI population, and the OBR's equity price growth determinant. ## Costing The costing has no static impact, given that the measure applies to a new population.

The new lifetime limits will be increased to \u00a324 million for nonknowledge intensive companies and \u00a340 million for knowledge intensive companies. The measure will also expand the gross asset test thresholds to \u00a330 million before share issue and \u00a335 million after. This measure will be effective from 6 April 2026. ## The tax base The tax base for this measure is an estimate of companies who are at, or close to, the existing limits of the Enterprise Investment Scheme and Venture Capital Trust scheme. The tax base is derived using HMRC administrative data. The tax base is grown over the forecast horizon using the OBR's forecast for Gross Domestic Product (GDP), equity prices and business investment. ## Costing The costing accounts for a behavioural response whereby companies close to the existing limits are expected to raise additional investment towards the new limits, and a proportion of investment is reallocated from other companies who are at an earlier stage of their development. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +0m | -60m | -45m | -50m | -55m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the behavioural response. ## Venture Capital Schemes: Reduce the VCT scheme Income Tax relief from 6 April 2026 ## Measure description This measure reduces the upfront Venture Capital Trust (VCT) Income Tax relief from 30% to 20%, to better balance the amount of upfront tax relief offered by VCTs compared to the Enterprise Investment Scheme and ensure funds are targeting the highest growth companies. This measure will be effective from 6th April 2026. ## The tax base The tax base is the existing investment into Venture Capital Trusts, which is taken from administrative data which HMRC receives from Regulation 21A forms submitted by the VCTs. The tax base is grown over the forecast horizon using the OBR's Gross Domestic Product at market prices determinant. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure tax regimes to the tax base described above. The costing accounts for a behavioural response whereby investors alter or reduce the way they invest into VCT, including reallocating some investment to the Enterprise Investment Scheme. ## Exchequer impact"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "(\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +0m | +125m | +95m | +95m | +100m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the behavioural response. ## UK Listing Relief: Stamp Duty Reserve Tax relief for transfers of a company's securities for a threeyear period from the point of listing, effective from 27 November 2025 ## Measure description This measure introduces a relief from the 0.5% Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT) charge for transfers of company's securities for three years from the point the company lists on a UK regulated market. The measure will be effective from 27 November 2025. ## Tax base The tax base is the projected value of secondary transfers of shares in newly listed companies, including Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). The estimate identifies historic new listings from London Stock Exchange Group New Issues and IPO Summary data then calculates the value of secondary transfers subject to SDRT in the 3 years following their listing, based on Certificateless Registry for Electronic Share Transfer (CREST) data. This costing assumes that future listing activity is in line with the 9-year average to 2023 to 2024, indicating approximately \u00a314bn to \u00a317bn of capital raised from new listings per year. The tax base is projected across the forecast using the OBR Equity Price Index forecast. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure tax regimes to the tax base described above. The costing accounts for two separate behavioural effects: forestalling by investors who accelerate share purchases just before the exemption ends, and the encouragement of a number of additional UK listings . ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | -25m | -35m | -45m | -50m | -50m | -50m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the tax base, and the number of additional UK listings. ## Youth Guarantee: Provide targeted support for young people to earn or learn, including a jobs guarantee, starting from 2026 ## Measure description This measure guarantees six-month paid work placements for every eligible 18 to 21-year-old who has been on Universal Credit (UC) and looking for work for 18 months. Initial placements will start from 2026 and the scheme will cover 100% of employment costs at 25 hours per week at the relevant minimum wage, as well as funding wrap around support and onboarding costs. ## The cost base AME savings from the programme are as a result of lower welfare spending given individuals will have a reduced UC entitlement while in employment. ## Costing The costing is estimated by calculating a UC saving per placement and then applying this to estimated cohort volumes.

The relief will apply to goods valued under \u00a3100, with a second-tier limit of \u00a3200 for a set list of items usually valued over the \u00a3100 limit, but which play an important role in tackling poverty. The relief will only apply to donations made to registered charities and Charitable Incorporated Organisations (CIOs) and will be administered in an approach consistent with existing practices for donations. This measure will have effect from the 1 April 2026. ## The tax base The tax base consists of business donations of goods to charity for onward donation or use in charitable services. This is estimated using data from the annual reports of a sample of charities that distribute large volumes of donated goods to people in need in the UK and responses to a 2025 consultation on the VAT treatment of business donations of goods. The tax base is grown over the forecast horizon using the OBR's forecast for growth in nominal consumer expenditure ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure tax regimes to the tax base described above. No behavioural effects are modelled in the costing, as any increase in donations is expected to come mainly from goods currently being disposed of, which would have no tax impact. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030/31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | -10m | -10m | -10m | -10m | -10m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main area of uncertainty is the precise size of the tax base. However, evidence from the consultation and further research strongly indicates that size is relatively small. ## Cross-border VAT grouping: Revert to unconditional whole entity cross-border VAT grouping from 26 November 2025 ## Measure description This measure removes the conditions attached to cross-border VAT grouping for VAT group members in certain EU member states. This means multiple businesses under shared control with a UK presence can be treated as a single entity for VAT purposes, regardless of the location of the overseas businesses. This measure will be effective from 26 November 2025. ## The tax base The tax base consists of transactions between businesses in the same UK cross-border VAT group where irrecoverable VAT would be due if crossborder VAT"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "grouping was not allowed.

Business Rates Retention: Extend Greater London Authority enhanced business rates retention arrangements, and pilot Business Rate Retentions for West England Combined Authority, Cornwall, and Liverpool City Region, for three years from April 2026 ## Measure description At Autumn Budget 2024, the government extended the arrangements that allow the Greater London Authority and local authorities in some areas to retain a greater share of their business rates into 2025-26. This measure extends these arrangements for a further three years until the end of March 2029 and will be effective from 1 April 2026. ## The cost base The cost base is the business rates forecast and the expected foregone grant allocation to local authorities benefiting from additional business rates retention. It is assumed in the baseline that the Greater London Authority and local authorities would revert to the standard 50% business rates retention from 2026-27 onwards. ## Costing As a result of the increased business rates retention arrangements, authorities will retain more business rates and increase spending financed by locally generated revenues. This is offset by a reduction in central government grant to those local authorities, and therefore a reduction in spending financed by grant income. Authorities will gain from any income retained above their business rates baseline due to growth in their business rates base, which is reflected in the estimated exchequer impact. It is assumed that 25% of the additional income above the baseline is placed into local authorities' reserves. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +0m | -5m | -10m | +0m | +0m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the forecast growth of the business rates base. ## Soil and Land Remediation: DEFRA grant scheme to support Local Authority remediation of land ## Measure description This measure provides financial support to public bodies -including local, combined and mayoral authorities -to cover the unaffordable portion of landfill tax costs that may prevent land remediation projects from going ahead. It focussed on sites where contamination poses risks to health, the environment, property, and where remediation would unlock economic, social, and environmental benefits. ## The tax base The"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "tax base refers to the revenue HM Treasury receives from landfill tax each financial year. Currently, there is no allocated budget for capital expenditure in this area meaning the pre-measures baseline for grant spending is zero. ## Costing Without grant support, the full cost of landfill tax is unaffordable for public bodies -meaning remediation would not happen, no landfill tax would be collected, and the land would remain unused. By making these projects financially viable, the scheme is expected to generate additional revenue for HM Treasury through landfill tax receipts, while also delivering wider benefits such as increased land and house values and environmental improvements. The costing adds the forecast grant support spending to the expected increased revenue received in landfill tax. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +0m | +10m | +35m | +10m | +10m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main areas of uncertainty in this costing relate to site-specific variation in contamination levels and remediation costs and the behavioural response to the measure. ## Personal Tax: Maintain the personal income tax and equivalent national insurance thresholds at current levels for a further three years until April 2031 ## Measure description This measure maintains the income tax Personal Allowance at \u00a312,570 and the higher rate threshold at \u00a350,270; and the additional rate threshold at \u00a3125,140, all from April 2028 to April 2031. The Personal Allowance threshold applies UK-wide. The higher rate threshold for non-savings, dividend and property income and for property income will apply to taxpayers in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, and for savings and dividend income it will apply UK-wide. This measure maintains the NICs Primary Threshold (PT) and Lower Profits Limit (LPL) at \u00a312,570 from April 2028 until April 2031. The NICs Upper Earnings Limit (UEL) and Upper Profits Limit (UPL) will be maintained at \u00a350,270 from April 2028 to April 2031. The Upper Secondary Threshold and Apprentices Upper Secondary Threshold will stay fixed at \u00a350,270 per annum until April 2031, to remain aligned with the UEL and UPL. This measure will be implemented on 06 April 2028. ## Tax base and data The tax base is an estimate of the income in excess of the thresholds. This is estimated using HMRCs Personal Tax Model. The costing reflects the following data sources: - The main source of data is from the 2022-23 Survey of Personal Incomes. - The tax base is projected using the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) economic forecast. The overall estimate of the tax base in 2028-29 is around \u00a32 trillion of income. ## Static costing The static exchequer impact is calculated by applying the pre- and postmeasure tax regimes to the tax base described above. This results in the following static costing: ## Static Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +0m | +0m"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "| +3,325m | +7,650m | +11,890m | ## Post-behavioural costing This costing builds in behavioural effects for individuals with income taxable at the higher and additional rates of tax. Estimates of the behavioural effects of the individuals outlined above are based on the Taxable Income Elasticities, which estimates how taxable income changes in response to changes in tax rates. These behavioural effects reduce the static costing by \u00a3180m (1.3%) in 2030-31. The costing is also adjusted to reflected Tax Motivated Incorporations (TMIs) as a result of this measure. The OBR also expect workers to shift part of the incidence of the tax increase onto employers, by bargaining for a higher nominal wage. The impact of this on nominal wages and profits is captured in a behavioural adjustment to the costing . More detail on the OBR's assessment is set out in the EFO. ## Post-behavioural Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |--------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact 1 | +0m | +0m | -25m | +3,365m | +7,780m | +12,435m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing surround CPI growth as well as the size of the tax base towards the end of the costing period, and the behavioural response. 1 A slightly higher yield from Personal Tax Threshold Freezes is presented in the OBR's EFO due to an error identified in the calculation of the shift of some of the incidence of the tax increase being passed onto employers after the forecast had closed. ## National Insurance: Maintain the secondary threshold for employer contributions at current level for a further three years until April 2031 ## Measure description This measure maintains the National Insurance contributions (NICs) Secondary Threshold (ST) at \u00a35,000 from April 2028 until April 2031. ## The tax base The tax base is pay between the secondary threshold and what the secondary threshold would have been if uprated by CPI. The tax base is estimated via the HMRC Personal Tax Model using Survey of Personal Incomes data for 2021-22, projected in line with OBR economic determinants. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure tax regimes to the tax base described above. The costing accounts for a behavioural response whereby there may be some greater incentive to incorporate. However, this is assumed to be negligible. The OBR assumes the incidence of this measure is shared across lower wages and lower profits. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +0m | -5m | +290m | +615m | +925m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the tax base. ## Student Loans: Freeze Plan 2 repayment threshold for three years from 6 April 2027 ## Measure description This measure maintains the repayment threshold for plan 2 student loans at its financial year 26-27 level until"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "April 2030, when it will increase annually by inflation. ## The tax base The tax base consists of undergraduates who studied between 2012 and 2022 and are either currently earning above the repayment threshold or are expected to do so by 2027-28 to 2029-30. The analysis uses historical earnings data to predict the future earnings of borrowers. Earnings pathways are derived from Student Loans Company and HMRC data and uprated over time by OBR earnings growth forecasts. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure threshold freezes to the tax base described above. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +285m | +5,915m | +255m | +290m | +355m | +380m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to student loan repayment forecasts, which are inherently uncertain as they are driven by a number of factors, including borrower behaviour, inflation and household residual income. ## Property Income: Introduce separate tax rates for property income at 22% for the property basic rate, 42% for the property higher rate and 47% for the property additional rate, from 6 April 2027 ## Measure description This measure creates a separate income tax rate for property rental income which increases tax on property income for unincorporated landlords by adding 2 percentage points to the basic rate, higher rate, and additional rate. This measure will be effective from 6 April 2027. ## The tax base The tax base consists of all individuals and partnerships that receive property income. It is estimated using HMRC administrative data from the 2023/24 Self-Assessment returns. The tax base is grown over the forecast horizon using the OBR's forecast for growth in land and property income. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure tax regimes to the tax base described above. The costing accounts for a behavioural response whereby some landlords choose to operate through a company structure rather than as an unincorporated business to avoid the increased property income taxation, though this response is expected to be limited. The costing also accounts for the impact of this measure on rental prices and house prices. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +0m | +5m | +590m | +435m | +445m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the behavioural response. ## Dividend Income: Increase tax rates on dividend income by 2ppts at the ordinary and upper rate from 6 April 2026 ## Measure description This measure increases the ordinary and upper rate of dividend tax by two percentage points.

It applies to taxable savings income, excluding Individual Savings Account returns and savings income covered by the Personal Allowance, Personal Savings Allowance, or the Starting Rate for Savings. This measure will be effective from 6 April 2027. ## The tax base The tax base consists of taxable savings income held by individuals. This is estimated using HMRC's Personal Tax Model, drawing on administrative data from the 2022 -23 Survey of Personal Incomes. The tax base is grown over the forecast horizon using the OBR's forecast for growth in savings income. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure tax regimes to the tax base described above The costing accounts for a behavioural response whereby some individuals shift their savings into tax-advantaged products such as Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs). ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +5m | +55m | +525m | +470m | +505m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the tax base, behavioural response, and forecast of future returns to savings. ## Salary Sacrifice: Limit the value of salary sacrificed pension contributions that can receive employee and employer NICs relief to \u00a32,000 per year from 6 April 2029 ## Measure description This measure applies Class 1 Employee (Primary) and Employer (Secondary) National Insurance Contributions (NICs) to 'salary sacrificed' pension contributions above an annual cap of \u00a32,000, effective from 6 April 2029. The policy aims to restrict the incentive for employers and employees to use salary sacrifice arrangements for pension contributions to access additional NICs savings. ## Tax base and data The tax base consists of salary sacrifice and bonus sacrifice pension contributions above the \u00a32,000 annual cap. - The main data source is the 2024 ONS"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), from which estimates of the number of employees using salary sacrifice and the value of employee pension contributions are made. - The tax base is projected in line with the historic trends and the OBR's forecast for employment and wage growth. In 2024, it is estimated \u00a332bn of pensions contributions used salary sacrifice pension arrangements, with the value of contributions predominantly from higher and additional rate taxpayers. ## Static costing The static Exchequer impact is calculated by applying the pre- and postmeasure tax regimes to the tax base described above. This results in the following static costing: ## Static Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +0m | +0m | +0m | +4,870m | +5,070m | ## Post-behavioural costing The costing includes various behavioural responses, two key ones have been set out below: | Behaviour | Description | |-------------|---------------| | Employers may react to these reforms by changing how they compensate staff to replicate some of the savings afforded by the existing salary sacrifice regime. | The costing assumes that employers put 5% of pay growth of the affected population towards employer contributions.

The extent of the adjustment made reflects HMRCand OBR judgement. | |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Employees may smooth their contributions between pay periods to make efficient use of NICs exemption on contributions under \u00a32k. | The costing assumes an overall 5% reduction in the tax base from this behaviour. This adjustment reflects HMRC and OBR judgement. | The OBR also assume employers will seek to pass through some costs to wages. A behavioural adjustment has been made for this in the costing. The OBR's pass-through assumptions are detailed in their Economic and Fiscal Outlook. The costing also accounts for other behaviours, including: - Forestalling prior to the implementation of the measure (the bringing forward of contributions - Shifting towards other schemes (i.e. 'net pay arrangements' or ' relief at source') - Increased contributions to meet auto-enrolment minimums - Reduction in contributions by individuals in DC schemes The table below sets out the post-behavioural costing ## Post-behavioural Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | -40m | -55m | -75m | +4,845m | +2,585m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties relate to behavioural responses, the use of ASHE sample data, population growth, and economic factors such as wage growth. The extent to which employers and employees will adapt their behaviour in response to the measure is particularly uncertain. ## Capital Gains Tax: Reduce Capital Gains Tax relief on qualifying disposals to employee ownership trusts from 100% to 50% from 26 November 2025 ## Measure description This measure restricts the amount of relief from Capital Gains"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "Tax (CGT) available on qualifying disposals of shares made to the trustees of an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT). 50% of the gain on disposal to the trustees of an EOT will be treated as the disposer's chargeable gain for CGT purposes. The remaining 50% of the gain will not be chargeable at the time of disposal but will continue to be held over to come into charge on any future disposal of the shares by the trustees of the EOT. This measure will be effective from 26 November 2025. ## Tax base and data The tax base is the total chargeable gains arising from disposals of company shares to EOTs. - The key data source is the EOT application clearance data submitted to HMRC for the 2023 calendar year, which includes information on the amount paid by EOTs for company shares and covers around 97% of EOTs created in 2023. For EOTs without valuations or not submitting clearance, estimates are derived using averages from the available data. - The base is projected forward using the growth rate relating to financial assets in the CGT forecast. - We assume that the tax base is split into two groups according to policy and operational expert judgement and published EOT evaluation: 55% company owners planning exits for retirement purposes; 45% other exits. The overall estimate of the tax base (i.e. total chargeable gains) in the first full year of the measure (2026 -27) is approximately \u00a36.8 billion. ## Static costing The static Exchequer impact is calculated by applying the pre- and postmeasure tax regimes to the tax base described above. This results in the following static costing: ## Static Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +225m | +785m | +905m | +1000m | +1,100m | ## Post-behavioural costing The costing includes assumptions about the behavioural responses, which have been set out below: | Behaviour | Description | |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Behaviour from company owners planning exits for retirement purposes (55% of the tax base). | A retention rate elasticity of 4.0 for CGT financial and non-residential property assets reflects HMRCanalysis of realised CGT gains in the UK in the period from 1998 to 2018. The costing assumes a lower retention rate elasticity of 1.3 on this portion of the tax base. This is calculated using a bottom-up approach which assesses that there are a narrower range of behavioural routes available to be used by these taxpayers after the introduction of the policy (relative to the population below). | | Behaviour from other taxpayers (45% of the tax base) | For this population, the costing assumes that the 4.0 elasticity will be reduced by 15% to 3.4.

The charge will be based on a targeted revaluation exercise carried out by the Valuation Office, on the basis of property values in 2026. It will apply in addition to existing Council Tax. Among other areas the government will consult on the criteria for and mechanism through which to deliver support, reliefs, exemptions and appeals. ## Tax base and data The tax base comprises properties in England valued above \u00a32 million in 2026. Estimates combine commercial valuation data, Council Tax statistics, SDLT transaction data, and Valuation Office data. Further adjustments, including for social housing, reduce the base by 2.5%. OBR property price forecasts and new-build assumptions are used to project property prices and volumes, resulting in an estimated 165,000 properties subject to the tax in 2028 -29. ## Static costing Static costing multiplies projected properties by band charges, uprated by CPI from 2029 -30. ## Static Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +0m | +0m | +605 | +620m | +635m | ## Post-behavioural costing The costing includes two main behavioural responses, which have been set out below: | Behaviour | Description | |----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Price Capitalisation | Based on a range of studies 2 , 100% capitalisation is assumed, phased in over 3 years.

Bunching elasticities of 1.0 to 1.5 are used. These are adjusted downward compared to the SDLT empirical evidence to reflect the smaller impact on credit constraints of a recurring tax compared to an upfront transaction tax. The elasticities are used to estimate a value range above a threshold for which properties would see price effects additional to the capitalisation effect, using the net present value of the tax. | The costing also includes a small adjustment for changes to the growth in the stock of impacted properties. The costing includes adjustments for compliance, appeals and an assumed support scheme: - Non-payment: The assumption reflects the Council Tax non-payment rate uplifted to account for the owners, rather than occupiers, being liable for the tax. - Appeals: Successful appeals are assumed based on Council Tax and Business Rates appeal success rates. - Support scheme and inability to pay: The Wealth and Assets Survey is used to estimate the share of households who may be unable to pay the charge, including those who may qualify for a support scheme, which is to be consulted on. The costing also accounts for impacts on other tax heads. Price capitalisation affects SDLT, CGT, IHT, and ATED receipts. Transaction impacts include temporary reductions pre-implementation and increases in churn postimplementation, impacting SDLT and CGT receipts. ## Post-behavioural Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | -60m | -120m | -155m | +400m | +430m | +435m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing surround the size of the tax base, behavioural and compliance effects and resultant impacts on other tax heads. 3 Best, M.C. and Kleven, H.J.

The new FYA applies only to new expenditure on eligible assets, including plant or machinery for leasing but excluding second-hand assets and cars, and affects both Corporation Tax and Income Tax payers. The new FYA will come into effect from 1 January 2026, and the new WDA rate will be effective from 1 April 2026 for Corporation Tax and 6 April 2026 for Income Tax. ## The tax base The tax base consists of all new and pooled expenditure on plant and machinery assets eligible for WDAs, and new expenditure eligible for the new FYA, which excludes second-hand assets and cars. This is estimated using company tax and self-assessment returns as well as other data sources such as survey data and transport statistics. The tax base is grown over the forecast horizon using the OBR's economic determinants, including forecast for growth in business investment. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure tax regimes to the tax base described above.

GGY is the revenue retained by gambling operators after paying out winnings to customers. The costing reflects the following data sources: - Gambling Commission Industry Statistics: Used to estimate GGY by sector and channel (remote vs non-remote) - HMRC Betting and Gaming Receipts Statistics: Used for actual duty receipts and to estimate the split between different types of gambling; and - The OBR's Betting and Gaming duties forecast: Used to project the tax base over the forecast period. The overall estimate of the tax base (i.e. the amount of GGY for each affected tax head) in 2026-27 is around \u00a310 billion: around \u00a32.3 billion for remote GBD, around \u00a37.1 billion for RGD and around \u00a30.3 billion for Bingo Duty. ## Static costing The static Exchequer impact is calculated by applying the pre- and postmeasure tax regimes to the tax base described above.

This change ensures that VAT is applied to the full fare charged by operators, rather than just their margin. The measure will be effective from 2 January 2026. ## The tax base The tax base is an estimate of the portion of private hire vehicle fares with VAT not currently applied, which will now be subject to VAT following the implementation of the measure. The tax base is projected over the forecast using the OBR's nominal household consumption forecast. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure tax regimes to the tax base described above. The costing accounts for a behavioural response whereby a proportion of drivers will register for VAT voluntarily, as well as changes in supply and demand. An allowance is also made for possible attrition due to noncompliance or other behavioural responses. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +190m | +725m | +665m | +655m | +650m | +675m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the behavioural response. ## Low Value Imports: Reform the customs treatment of low value imports from March 2029 ## Measure description This measure will remove the customs duty relief on goods imported into the UK valued at \u00a3135 or below.

The international maritime expansion also broadens the scope of the UK ETS to include the remaining 50% of emissions from domestic voyages between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. This measure will be effective from 1 January 2028. ## The tax base The tax base includes emissions from maritime vessels over 5000 Gross Tonnage, excluding non-commercial government vessels, relating to international journeys. The tax base also includes emissions from these maritime vessels relating to domestic journeys between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. This tax base is derived using data from the Department for Transport (DfT) and the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ). The tax base is grown over the forecast horizon using projections of emissions from maritime vessels, along with HMRCs Carbon Price Forecast. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure tax regimes to the tax base described above. This costing does not include any adjustment for a behavioural response. The emissions data used in the tax base already incorporates expected changes in demand. This accounts for the UK ETS Authority initially increasing the number of allowances to account for the extra emissions brought into scope of the scheme, in line with the new expected tax base. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +0m | +0m | +75m | +290m | +285m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainty in this costing relates to the sensitivity of the costing to movements in the UK carbon price. ## Defined Benefit (DB) Pension"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "Scheme Surplus Extraction: Introduce flexibilities for employers and direct payments to members from April 2027 ## Measure description This measure will allow trustees of more DB schemes to change scheme rules to share surplus funds with sponsoring employers and scheme members, helping support investment in businesses and the wider economy.

This measure increases the standard rate each year in line with the Retail Price Index (RPI). This is already included in the OBR's forecast so does not impact the tax base or have an Exchequer impact. This measure will also increase the lower rate each year by the same cash amount as the standard rate in order to keep the gap between the two rates constant in cash terms. This measure will be effective from 1 April 2026. ## The tax base The tax base consists of all lower rated material (excluding exemptions) that is sent to landfill in England and Northern Ireland. This is estimated using HMRC administrative data. The tax base is grown over the forecast horizon using the OBR's Landfill Tax forecast. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure tax regimes to the tax base described above. The costing implicitly captures a reduction in non-compliance resulting from misdescription, and accounts for further behavioural responses including an expected reduced demand for landfill. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +35m | +60m | +85m | +110m | +130m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the behavioural response. ## Soft Drink Industry Levy: Reduce the levy threshold from 5g to 4.5g/100ml and extend to milk-based drinks and milk substitutes from 1 January 2028 ## Measure description This measure reduces the"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) standard rate threshold from 5g to 4.5g of total sugar per 100ml.

This measure will be effective from 1 January 2028. ## The tax base The tax base consists of all sales of soft drinks containing added sugar brought into scope of SDIL by the threshold and exemption changes, estimated using data on the sales of sugar sweetened beverages. The tax base is grown over the forecast horizon using the OBR's forecast for growth in the population. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure tax regimes to the tax base described above. The costing includes two key behavioural assumptions: - It is assumed that 65% of products are reformulated to avoid the levy, in line with evidence from SDIL's introduction . - For products that do not reformulate it is assumed that the duty is passed on to consumers, resulting in reduced demand. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +0m | +10m | +40m | +40m | +40m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the behavioural response, particularly the extent of reformulation. ## Non-reimbursed Homeworking Expenses: Remove the tax relief available from 6 April 2026 ## Measure description This measure removes the ability for employees to claim a deduction from earnings from HMRC if they have incurred additional household costs when being required to work from home. Employers can still reimburse employees for these costs where eligible without deducting Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions. This measure will be effective from 6 April 2026. ## The tax base The tax base is an estimate of employees who are obliged to work from home by their employer and who claim the homeworking allowance. This is derived using the HMRC administrative data.

The \u00a31 million limit applies to the combined value of qualifying agricultural and business assets that can receive 100% relief. The rate of relief will be 50% thereafter, and in all circumstances for shares designated as 'not listed' on the markets of recognised stock exchanges, such as the Alternative Investment Market (AIM). This measure will be effective from 6 April 2026. ## The tax base The tax base consists of all estates liable to IHT with qualifying agricultural and business assets worth at least \u00a31 million , as recorded in HMRC's administrative data. The tax base is grown over the forecast horizon using the OBR's forecast for growth in equity prices, average house prices, and cash deposit growth, as well as the projected number of UK deaths. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure tax regimes to the tax base described above.

It will be effective from 1 January 2027. ## The cost base The cost base is the extra PPF compensation and FAS assistance created by applying capped CPI uprating to pre-1997 accruals for eligible members. It is estimated from PPF valuation data and the FAS cashflow forecast as at 31 March 2025. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure rules to the cost base described above; it adds the cash cost of higher FAS payments and the non-cash cost for PPF from the unwinding of the discount rate on higher liabilities, and nets off the related income tax receipts. The costing assumes no behavioural change because the policy only affects past service. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | -1,255m | -60m | -60m | -65m | -70m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to future CPI and discount-rate assumptions, the size and composition of the cost base. ## Personal Independence Payment: Not proceeding with Spring Statement 2025 reforms to eligibility ## Measure description This measure scores not proceeding with the changes to Personal Independence Payment (PIP) eligibility which required people to score 4 points in any daily living activity to be eligible, as announced at Spring Statement 2025. ## The cost base The cost base for this measure is estimated from the current and forecasted PIP caseload and those of passported benefits like Carer's Allowance and Universal Credit"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "Carer's Element and DWP administrative data. ## Costing The costing is calculated by the annual difference in the PIP award rate of those impacted by the additional requirement and multiplying this by the affected claimants each month, both existing and future.

Behavioural changes among new and existing claimants are also accounted for in the costing, including an increase in mandatory reconsiderations and appeals which reduced the scale of impact. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | -235m | -1,755m | -3,350m | -4,495m | -5,345m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing are on behavioural assumptions and on assessment capacity to undertake award reviews when due. ## Winter Fuel Payment: Target to pensioners with taxable income below or equal to \u00a335,000 from Winter 2025 ## Measure description This measure targets Winter Fuel Payments in England and Wales to pensioners with a taxable income below or equal to \u00a335,000. The Winter Fuel Payment will be made to all eligible pensioners who do not opt-out and the full value of the payment will be recovered via HMRC for individuals with taxable incomes exceeding \u00a335,000 and not in receipt of Pension Credit, Universal Credit, income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA), income-based Jobseeker ' s Allowance (JSA), Income Support, Child Tax Credit or Working Tax Credit. This measure will be effective from Winter 2025-26. Inclusion of devolved government funding implications is without prejudice decisions made by those governments. Figures are presented on a UK-wide basis for transparency and consistency. Winter heating assistance is devolved in Scotland, and Winter Fuel Payments are a transferred matter in Northern Ireland. All figures reflect the UK government's policy impact on England and Wales, as well as resulting changes to the Scottish Block Grant Adjustment and Northern Ireland Executive funding. ## The cost base The cost base is estimated using benefit caseload, expenditure forecasts and official statistics from the DWP publication 'Income -related benefits: estimates of takeup'. The tax base for the tax charge consists of all pensioners in England and Wales with total income above \u00a335,000 who are in receipt of the Winter Fuel Payment. This is estimated using HMRC's Personal Tax Model, based on administrative data from the 2022 -23 Survey of Personal Incomes. The tax base is grown over the forecast horizon using the OBR's forecast for growth in pensioner incomes. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure benefit regimes to the cost base described above and accounts for behavioural responses of increased Winter Fuel Payment opt outs for those eligible for the HMRC recovery. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | -1,785m | -1,390m | -910m | -1,330m | -1,340m | -1,325m | ## Areas of"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the behavioural response. ## Universal Credit: Changes to the standard allowance and health element to protect existing claimants and new health element claimants who meet the Severe Conditions Criteria from April 2026 ## Measure description This measure scores the changes made during the passage of the Universal Credit (UC) Act to the reforms to the rate of the UC Health Element for existing claimants and to the UC Standard Allowance for recipients under 25. New and existing recipients who meet the Severe Conditions Criteria will be protected from the UC Health Element reforms. This measure will be effective from 6 April 2026. ## The cost base The cost base for this measure uses OBR forecasts for the Universal Credit Health Element and the Standard Allowance caseloads. ## Costing The costing is estimated by reducing the rate of UC Health Element to \u00a350 a week until 2029/30 for new claimants only while protecting existing claimants and those who meet the Severe Conditions Criteria, compared to the counterfactual of all UC Health Element claimants. The costing to protect the UC award of people who are under 25 and in receipt of the UC Health Element is estimated by using caseload projections to ensure their total payment increases at a rate higher than CPI. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | -245m | -475m | -630m | -790m | -945m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the behavioural response. ## Loan Charge: Government response to the independent review ## Measure description The loan charge was announced at Budget 2016 and introduced into law in 2017. Its purpose was to tackle historical use of contrived tax avoidance schemes that sought to avoid income tax and National Insurance by disguising remuneration as a form of non-taxable payment (typically a loan). In January 2025, the then Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury commissioned Ray McCann, a former president of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, to lead an independent review of the loan charge. The review's report was published at Budget 2025, alongside the government's response. The government has announced that it is accepting all but one of the review's recommendations. The review recommends that the government introduce a settlement opportunity to encourage those who have not settled their avoidance with HMRC to do so. The settlement opportunity will allow people to settle their loan charge liabilities with HMRC on concessionary terms. Under the terms of the settlement opportunity, everyone who comes forward will see a \u00a35,000 reduction in their outstanding liabilities. They will also be able to offset a proportion of the fees assumed to have been paid to the promoters of the schemes against their liabilities. HMRC will also forgo all late payment interest, will not collect any inheritance tax that has arisen from the use"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "of trust structures, and will only charge penalties in egregious cases. The maximum deduction will be \u00a370,000. This measure will be effective from Royal Assent to Finance Act 2026. ## The tax base The tax base for this measure is the estimate HMRC has made of outstanding loan charge liabilities from individuals and employers that HMRC expected to collect as a result of compliance activity (including agreeing settlements) and debt collection activity, without a policy change. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the average settlement discount to the yield due from the individuals and employers that HMRC model will settle in the tax base described above. The static costing applies the discount to settlement yield in the tax base. The costing accounts for a behavioural response whereby the settlement opportunity, offering substantial discounts and reducing some customers' liabilities to zero, is expected to incentivise settlements and resolve customers' outstanding liabilities more quickly . ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | -25m | -95m | -30m | +35m | -155m | -95m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the behavioural response. ## Compensation Payments: Deliver recommendations from Volume 1 of the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry's final report ## Measure description This measure enables implementation of the recommendations in the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry Report (Volume 1). Redress payments are provided by the Department for Business and Trade and Post Office Limited under four current schemes: Horizon Shortfall Scheme (HSS); Horizon Shortfall Scheme Appeals (HSSA); Group Litigation Order (GLO) Scheme; and Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme (HCRS), and a new scheme is being established for family members of Horizon Scandal victims. The Overturned Convictions scheme is now closed. This measure was announced on 9 October 2025, and implementation is ongoing. ## The cost base The cost base for this measure includes estimates of cost impacts of changes to existing Post Office Horizon scandal redress schemes delivered by Post Office Limited and the Department for Business and Trade. It also includes initial estimates of the number of family members of Horizon Scandal victims who are expected to be eligible to claim compensation through a new redress scheme that is being established by the Department for Business and Trade. ## Costing The costing is based on expected impacts of changes to the approach taken in existing redress schemes and initial estimates of the expected number of family members who may be eligible and come forward to claim under the new scheme, expected levels of redress payments and the timing of redress payments. This costing assumes no behavioural impacts. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | -105m | -55m | -55m | +0m | +0m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "the final design of the new family members scheme, number of claimants that come forward, how quickly claims progress and the scale of awards made. ## Compensation Payments: Post Office Capture Redress Scheme ## Measure description This measure provides financial redress for those affected by the Post Office's Capture accounting software. Payments are provided by the Department for Business and Trade. This measure has been effective since 29 October 2025. ## The cost base The cost base for this measure is the estimated number of people eligible to claim compensation through the Capture Redress Scheme. ## Costing The costing estimates the expected numbers of claimants within the Capture Redress Scheme, expected levels of redress payments, and the timing of redress payments.

These changes came into effect on 23 January 2025 and 30 June 2025. ## The tax base The tax base is the expected Customs Duty revenue from the relevant commodity codes impacted, had the measure not been implemented. The tax base has been projected across the forecast using the OBR's forecasts fo r non-oil goods imports. ## Costing The static costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure tax regimes to the tax base described above. For the Economic Prosperity Deal with the US, a behavioural adjustment is made to account for the proportion of traders that utilise the preferential tariff rates and traders diverting trade to benefit from preferential tariffs. For the extension to tariff suspensions, a behavioural adjustment is made to account for the incentive for traders to forestall by bringing forward imports to avoid paying duty once the measure ends. For the rule changes to the steel safeguard measure, a behavioural adjustment is made to account for the proportion of traders that utilise the quotas, traders retiming or diverting trade so as not to pay additional duty, and changes in demand due to the rule changes where this isn't possible. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact |"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "-55m | -150m | -95m | -100m | -100m | -105m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the tax base and behavioural response. ## Fiscally Neutral Measures ## Increase to the Money and Pensions Service (MaPS) Levy ## Measure description This measure will increase the Money and Pensions Service (MaPS) levy collected from Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)-regulated financial services firms. The additional funding will support MaPS's statutory functions, including debt advice and money guidance, and assist delivery of the Government's Financial Inclusion Strategy. The increased levy envelope will apply for three years, from 1 April 2026 to 31 March 2029, in line with the budget agreed at the most recent Spending Review. ## The tax base The MaPS levy is paid by FCA-regulated financial services firms, including banks, building societies, insurers, and investment firms. Each year, once the MaPS budget is agreed by DWP and HM Treasury ministers, the FCA apportions the total levy across regulated firms in accordance with its established fee-block methodology and invoices each firm for their share. The funds are collected alongside other FCA levies and transferred to DWP. The increase from 2026-27 to 2028-29 reflects the higher funding requirement agreed at the 2025 Spending Review. ## Costing The levy increase reflects the Spending Review 2025 agreement to expand MaPS funding. It will result in additional DEL allocations of around \u00a34 million in 2026-27, \u00a38 million in 2027-28, and \u00a312.5 million in 2028-29, relative to the previous baseline. The total MaPS levy is expected to rise from approximately \u00a3185m in 2025-26 to \u00a3189m in 2026-27, \u00a3193m in 2027-28, and \u00a3197m in 202829. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) The table below shows the increase in MaPS levy receipts across the Spending Review period. The measure is fiscally neutral overall, with additional MaPS levy receipts offset by equivalent DEL allocations to DWP. | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +5m | +10m | +15m | +15m | +15m | Note: This is offset by increased DEL spending so is fiscally neutral. ## Areas of uncertainty The FCA invoices firms for the amount required, and has well-established collections practices, so forecast uncertainty is negligible. ## Increasing the Immigration Skills Charge (ISC) ## Measure description This measure increases the Immigration Skills Charge (ISC), representing a 32% increase in the charge to take account of inflation since its introduction in 2017. This means for small and charitable sponsors, the charge will increase from \u00a3364 to \u00a3480, and for medium and large sponsors from \u00a31,000 to \u00a31,320. This measure is expected to commence mid-December 2025. ## The tax base The tax base consists of the income derived from businesses paying the ISC when issuing a certificate of sponsorship for a foreign worker. It is estimated by multiplying ISC liable volumes by an estimated average length of stay, multiplied by the new ISC fee (weighted for the split of small/charitable"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "and medium/large sponsors, as per internal data). The tax base is projected over the forecast period based on internal projections of granted visa applications in the period 2025/26 to 2030/31 on routes subject to the ISC, internal length of stay data for applicable routes, and the proportional split of small and large sponsors. ## Costing The costing is estimated by multiplying the new volumes by the average length of stay, multiplied by the new ISC fee (weighted for the proportional split of small/charitable and medium/large sponsors). The difference is then taken from this and the estimated baseline income if the increase in ISC were not to happen.

Previously, businesses were categorised as medium, large, and very large using their UK revenue. The former large band, covering businesses with annual revenue between \u00a336m and \u00a31bn, is being split into two bands, B &amp; C (\u00a336m-\u00a3500m and \u00a3500m-\u00a31bn). The payments for bands A (revenues between \u00a310.2m-\u00a336m), B (\u00a336m-\u00a3500m), C (\u00a3500m-\u00a31bn), and D (above \u00a31bn) will be \u00a310,200, \u00a336,000, \u00a3500,000, and \u00a31m respectively. This measure will be effective from 1 April 2026. ## The tax base The Economic Crime (Anti Money Laundering) Levy is paid by businesses regulated under the Money Laundering Regulations. Businesses make payments based on their total annual UK revenue. The tax base is derived from returns from the three collectors of the levy (Financial Conduct Authority, HMRC, and the Gambling Commission) and then estimated over the forecast horizon using annual average growth rates of the population of businesses that are charged the levy. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure payment structures to the tax base described above. The costing accounts for a behavioural response where businesses make changes that mean they are not required to pay the levy. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +0m | +110m | +115m | +115m | +115m | Note: This is offset by increased DEL spending so is fiscally neutral. ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the tax base and the behavioural response. ## International Student Levy ## Measure description This measure introduces a new levy on international"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "students, of \u00a3925 per student per year of study, starting in August 2028. All providers will be given an allowance for the first 220 international students, for whom they will not pay the ISL charge. The income raised by the Levy will be fully reinvested into higher education and skills, including the reintroduction of targeted maintenance grants for priority courses. ## The tax base The tax base is non-UK (international) students enrolled at higher education providers in England. This is then grown using international student forecasts, which are based on existing data from HESA and the Home Office. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the \u00a3925 rate to the tax base described above. The revenue from the levy, is offset with equivalent DEL, making this fiscally neutral in each year. The fiscal impact of the allowance and any further policy development will be accounted for in the next forecast. Behavioural costing takes into account provider and student behaviour in response to the levy. Attrition is applied to the final costing before rounding. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +0m | +0m | +445m | +465m | +480m | Note: This is offset by increased DEL spending so is fiscally neutral. ## Areas of uncertainty The main area of uncertainty is international student forecasts and the behavioural assumption. ## Council Tax: \u00a35 precept flexibility for fire authorities from April 2026 ## Measure description This measure confirms the council tax referendum limit for Fire and Rescue Authorities will be set at \u00a35 for the period for 2026-27 to 2028-29. This measure will be effective from 1 April 2026. ## The tax base The tax base for this measure is the housing stock on which council tax will be paid. This is provided by the OBR. The tax base is grown over the forecast horizon using the OBR's forecast for all housing stock. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure tax regimes to the tax base described above. The costing accounts for a behavioural response whereby take up of the precept is assumed to be 95% and assumes that no additional receipts are transferred into reserves. The expenditure and receipts should net off each year and therefore this measure is fiscally neutral. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |-------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +0m | +0m | +0m | +0m | +0m | | o/w additional revenue | +0m | +25m | +45m | +70m | +70m | +75m | | o/w additional spending | +0m | -25m | -45m | -70m | -70m | -75m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainty in this costing relates to the uptake of the referendum principles by Fire and Rescue Authorities. ## Scottish Government Police and Fire Pensions ## Measure description This measure will"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "switch the budgeting treatment classification of the Scottish Government's police and fire pensions balancing payments from DEL to AME. This measure is a classification change and there are no changes to pension eligibility. This measure will take effect from 2025-26. ## The cost base The cost base for this measure consists of pensioners eligible for payments under the Scottish Government's police and fire public sector pensions. ## Costing This costing is estimated using Scottish Government and Government Actuary Department data on the total payments to pensioners minus total active contributions (the balancing payment) for those eligible for police and fire public sector pensions in Scotland. No behavioural impacts are expected as the measure is a classification change and there are no changes to pension eligibility. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | -350m | -350m | -350m | -350m | -360m | -370m | Note: This is offset by reduce DEL spending so is fiscally neutral. ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of active contributions and expected payment to pensioners. ## Closing the Tax Gap Measures ## Making better use of third-party data: Invest to acquire third-party data more frequently for interest and card sales from April 2028 ## Measure description This measure improves the provision of two key datasets already reported to HMRC; financial account information consisting of bank and building society interest (BBSI) and interest from other sources, and card sales data shared by providers of card acquiring services such as merchant acquirers. The reforms include more frequent and standardised reporting obligations to ensure tax identifiers are collected, reported and verified before submitting data to HMRC. These reforms will enable HMRC to pre-populate tax returns, automatically register taxpayers, and use data for more accurate PAYE coding and compliance nudges. This measure will be effective from April 2028. ## The tax base The tax base consists of all BBSI and other interest income received by individuals with a theoretical income tax liability, as well as all income and supplies covered by Merchant Acquirer or digital platforms data. This is estimated using HMRC administrative data and internal modelling. The tax base is grown over the forecast horizon using the OBR's forecast for growth in interest from UK banks, building societies, and other deposit takers, and for relevant groups, the OBR's forecast for growth in Self Ass essment income and VAT receipts. ## Costing This costing assumes that data matching rates will increase to 90% for BBSI and merchant acquirer data. We assume that nearly two-thirds of tax returns will be pre-populated by 2030/31; this assumption accounts for customers directly making their submissions to HMRC, and the usage of MTD software. The costing accounts for a behavioural response whereby individuals may shift savings into tax-free products or inflate their expenses to suppress net income, and some taxpayers may respond to new requirements by changing how or whether"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "they declare income. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +0m | +0m | +30m | +350m | +465m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the tax base and behavioural response. ## Digital prompts: Invest in new technology to provide taxpayers with real time digital prompts for VAT from April 2027 and Corporation Tax from April 2028 ## Measure description The government will invest \u00a359 million over the next five years to introduce transactional risking (TR), which delivers real-time, data-driven nudges within HMRC's digital services to help VAT and Corporation Tax (CT) taxpayers get their tax right before submitting returns. The measure applies to VAT and CT taxpayers using compatible third-party software and will be rolled out gradually as software developers integrate TR functionality. There are no specific exemptions or thresholds beyond software compatibility. This measure will be effective from April 2027 for VAT and April 2028 for CT. ## The tax base The tax base starting point stems from analysis conducted for the previously announced transaction risking for Self-Assessment measure, identifying all business taxpayers in SA with turnover over \u00a310,000. Separate behavioural adjustments for VAT and CT taxpayers are then applied, based on HMRC administrative data, to estimate the relevant populations in scope for this measure which use compatible software. Further behavioural adjustments are included, accounting for nudge efficiency changes over time, such as taxpayers consequently correcting errors or, alternatively, switching to software that does not support nudges to avoid intervention. ## Costing For the tax base populations in scope, benefits are estimated based on evidence from previous trials of nudges in the Online Tax Return SelfAssessment system. The costing is then estimated by applying the tax gap ratio between ITSA and VAT/CT to the baseline revenue from TR nudges. This is grown over the forecast horizon using the OBR's forecast for growth across the relevant tax receipts. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +5m | +40m | +140m | +245m | +210m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the behavioural responses of taxpayers, and the ITSA trial applicability to VAT and CT estimations. ## More timely payment for Self Assessment: Require ITSA taxpayers with Pay as You Earn (PAYE) income to pay more of their ITSA liabilities in-year via PAYE from April 2029 ## Measure description This measure requires income tax Self Assessment (ITSA) customers with Pay as You Earn (PAYE) income to pay their ITSA tax liabilities in-year through deductions from their PAYE income. Employers and pension providers will receive a tax code to enable the ITSA liability to be collected from the individual's pay provided there are sufficient funds to accommodate the deduction. This measure will be effective from 6 April 2029."}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "## The tax base The tax base consists of ITSA liabilities (excluding Capital Gains Tax) where customers with both ITSA and PAYE income sources meet the criteria for their liabilities to be coded out. The tax base is grown over the forecast horizon using the pre-measure SA receipts forecast. ## Costing The costing is estimated across two revenue channels: (i) additional revenue through debt prevention, and (ii) faster collection of tax through earlier inyear payments. A post-measure tax impact is estimated, noting pre-measure yield, and a behavioural response is applied to account for slightly higher noncompliance from taxpayers. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +0m | +0m | +85m | +605m | +235m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the behavioural response of taxpayers. ## Tax debt collection: Invest in HMRC's debt management capacity to increase collection of overdue tax debts ## Measure description This measure provides funding to increase HMRC debt management capacity through expanding HMRC's existing use of third -party debt collection agencies (DCAs) to increase the collection of overdue tax debt. This measure provides HMRC with \u00a364m additional funding over the next 5 years to place both new debts and debt stock over 12 months old with DCAs. The additional tax revenue from this measure comes from collecting tax debt that would otherwise be lost through write-off or remission (which impacts the non-payment tax gap), and from accelerating the collection of tax debt. This measure will be effective from November 2025. ## The tax base The tax base consists of the total value of new tax debts created each year and lower value tax debt stock over 12 months old sent to third party DCAs for collection. The baseline tax forecasts assume (1) tax debt paid grows in line with tax receipts and (2) tax debt created grows in line with tax receipts. ## Costing The costing has been calculated by estimating the additional tax collected as a result of the increased investment which enables additional tax debts to be sent to DCAs. The modelling uses data on previous DCA debt collection rates, including results from the recent trial placing older stock debts with DCAs, and the known costs of placing tax debts with these third parties. The costing accounts for a positive behavioural response whereby some taxpayers, upon learning their debts have been placed with a DCA, make payments directly to HMRC or enter into managed payment plans, resulting in recoveries beyond the initial placement period. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +25m | +35m | +55m | +90m | +170m | +485m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the tax base and the collection rates of older debts. ## Tax debt collection:"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "Invest in HMRC's debt management staff to increase collection of overdue tax debts ## Measure description The government will invest \u00a389m over the next five years to fund more HMRC debt management staff to increase HMRC's capacity to collect tax debts, building on previous announcements at Autumn Budget 2024 and Spring Statement 2025. The additional tax revenue from this measure comes from collecting tax debt that would otherwise be lost through write-off or remission (which impacts the non-payment tax gap), and from accelerating the collection of tax debt. This measure will be effective from 1 April 2027, when additional debt collection staff will be recruited. ## The tax base The tax base is derived from a forecast of the total tax debt balance over the scorecard period accounting for growth in total HMRC receipts using the OBR's tax receipts forecast. ## Costing The costing has been calculated by estimating the additional tax collected by additional staff. The value of tax debt collected accounts for diminishing returns as on average new and retained staff will process smaller debts than existing staff. The costing accounts for uncertainty over future levels of debt available for collection by applying an increasing optimism bias assumption that rises to 75% in the final two years of the scorecard period (29/30 and 30/31).

Where a business makes or receives a payment they knew or should have known was connected to fraud, HMRC will have powers to remove Gross Payment Status immediately, assess the business for the tax lost, and charge a penalty of up to 30% on the business or the business' officers. The time limit for reapplication, where GPS has been immediately removed, is increased from one year to five years. This measure will be effective from 6 April 2026. ## The cost/tax base The tax base consists of the estimated annual losses from fraud within the CIS. This is calculated using HMRC's assessment of labour fraud, based on the 2022 Labour Fraud in Construction assessment (c\u00a30.5bn per year). The tax base is grown over the forecast horizon using the OBR's forecast for growth in nominal imports. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure tax regimes to the tax base described above.

The government is increasing the rewards paid to informants who provide HMRC with high value information. For high value tax recoveries over \u00a31.5 million, HMRC will pay rewards up to 30% of the additional tax collected that would otherwise have gone unpaid. This measure will be effective from 26 November 2025. ## The tax base The tax base consists of all additional tax collected from high-value informant cases (over \u00a31.5 million) where information provided by an informant leads to successful compliance actions. This is estimated using HMRC compliance yield data and analysis of similar schemes. The tax base is grown over the forecast horizon using the OBR's forecast for growth in consumer price inflation. ## Costing The costing accounts for no static impact on taxpayer liabilities. The costing accounts for a behavioural response whereby the introduction of higher rewards encourages more informants to come forward with information that leads to additional tax being collected. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +0m | +10m | +55m | +95m | +65m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the behavioural response. ## Non-derecognition liabilities: Introduce antiavoidance rule to tackle certain arrangements involving non-derecognition liabilities from 26 November 2025 ## Measure description This measure introduces a new anti-avoidance provision, denying tax relief in respect of certain 'non -derecognition liabilities', where there are arrangements with a main purpose of obtaining a tax advantage This measure will be effective from 26 November 2025. ## The tax base The tax base consists of taxable profits that are shifted out of the UK tax net through arrangements described above. The value of the tax base is estimated using HMRC administrative data. The tax base is projected over the forecast horizon using the OBR's forecast of interest rates. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure tax regimes to the tax base described above.

It allows HMRC to access information more efficiently from advisers suspected of deliberate non-compliance, and apply penalties proportionate to the value of non-compliance. It applies to all tax advisers (including individuals, firms, and corporate entities) who are suspected of deliberately facilitating noncompliance. This measure will be effective from 1 April 2026. ## The tax base The tax base consists of HMRC internally referred cases where there is suspected deliberate non-compliance by tax advisers. This is estimated using historical operational data to determine the number of cases by noncompliance category and the amount of tax at risk. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the enhanced regime to the tax base described above, estimating the additional recovered penalty and tax yield as a result of this measure. The costing accounts for a behavioural response whereby some tax advisers (and their represented clients) are expected to change their behaviour to improve compliance in response to the strengthened regime. The estimates are grown over the forecast horizon using OBR economic determinants. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +15m | +50m | +55m | +55m | +55m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the tax base and behavioural response. ## Late Filing Penalties: Double late filing penalties for Corporation Tax from 1 April 2026 ## Measure description This measure increases the value of late filing penalties for Corporation Tax (CT) returns. The initial penalty for filing a return late will increase from \u00a3100 to \u00a3200, the penalty for filing more than three months late will increase from \u00a3200 to \u00a3400, the penalty for three successive failures will increase from \u00a3500 to \u00a31,000 and the penalty for three successive failures where the return is more than 3 months late will increase from \u00a31,000 to \u00a32,000. This applies to all CT customers required to file annual returns. This measure will come into effect for returns due to be filed on or after 1 April 2026. ## The tax base The tax base of the measure is companies who do not file CT returns at the required time. No determinants are involved with this measure. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure tax regimes to the tax base described above. The costing accounts for a behavioural response whereby the increase in penalty encourages prompt filing of returns, resulting in fewer penalties being issued. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "impact | +0m | +45m | +60m | +65m | +65m | +70m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the tax base and the behavioural response. ## Incorporation Relief: Require taxpayers to actively claim incorporation relief to improve compliance from 6 April 2026 ## Measure description This measure requires individuals to actively claim Incorporation Relief via Self Assessment when transferring a business to a company, rather than the relief being applied automatically. This measure will apply to transfers made on or after 6 April 2026. ## The tax base The tax base consists of all individuals who claim Incorporation Relief when transferring their business to a company. This is estimated using HMRC administrative data and analysis of business incorporations. The tax base is grown over the forecast horizon using the growth rate related to financial assets in the OBR's Capital Gains Tax forecast. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure tax regimes to the tax base described above.

Specifically, late payment penalty (LPP1) will rise from 3% to 4% at day 16, and from 3% to 4% at day 31, while the per annum rate for LPP2 remains at 10% per year. The rise will apply to VAT and ITSA from April 2027. This measure will be effective from April 2027. ## The tax base The tax base consists of all VAT-registered businesses and ITSA customers affected by Penalty Reform, estimated using HMRC administrative data and modelling of expected penalties under the new regime. The tax base is grown over the forecast horizon using the OBR's forecast for growth in ITSA receipts. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure tax regimes to the tax base described above. The costing accounts for a behavioural response whereby increasing the penalty rate is expected to encourage some taxpayers to pay their VAT liability on time and deter others from using HMRC debt as a financial planning option, though some may still prioritise other debts or lack the ability to pay. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +0m | +5m | +50m | +90m | +115m | ## Areas of uncertainty The"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the tax base and behavioural response. ## Penalty Reform: Introducing Penalty Reform for NMSA ## Measure description This measure introduces Penalty Reform (PR) for Self-Assessment customers who are not mandated to join Making Tax Digital (MTD), known as the nonmandated SA population (NMSA). It does not apply to SA customers already mandated to join MTD. This measure will be effective from 1 April 2027. ## The tax base The tax base consists of all Self-Assessment customers who are not mandated to join Making Tax Digital, estimated using HMRC administrative data on the ITSA population. The tax base is grown over the forecast horizon using the OBR's forecast for ITSA recei pts. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure penalty regimes to the tax base described above. No additional behavioural effects are anticipated for this group, as their filing and payment behaviour is expected to remain unchanged compared to previous modelling. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +0m | +0m | +5m | -45m | -30m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the tax base. ## Transitional penalties arrangements under Making Tax Digital ## Measure description The government will not apply late submission penalties to quarterly updates for the 2026-27 tax year for income tax Self Assessment taxpayers required to join MTD from April 2026 (sole traders and landlords with qualifying income over \u00a350,000). Penalties for missing the annual update will still apply in this first year, and customers will still need to submit their quarterly updates before they can submit their annual tax return. This measure will be effective from 6 April 2026. ## The cost/tax base The tax base is the revenue lost due to error and failure to take reasonable care by sole traders and landlords in the income tax Self Assessment population due to join MTD from April 2026. The forecast profile rises in line with the growth in liabilities and take-up, and is estimated using HMRC's analysis of the tax gap. ## Costing The costing has no static impact on taxpayer liabilities. The costing accounts for a behavioural response whereby the lack of penalties for missed quarterly updates is expected to reduce the rate at which taxpayers join MTD, and results in less efficient use of quarterly updates during the period. The reduced rate at which taxpayers join MTD under this measure also impacts the effectiveness of the transactional risking (digital prompting) element of MTD. An estimate of this is included in the overall exchequer impact below. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | -5m | -45m | +5m | +0m | +0m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "relate to the size of the tax base and the behavioural response. ## Transfer Pricing: Introduce a requirement for inscope multinationals to file an International Controlled Transactions Schedule from 1 January 2027 ## Measure description This measure gives the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs the power to introduce regulations requiring in-scope multinationals to file an International Controlled Transactions Schedule (ICTS) with HMRC on an annual basis. This measure is expected to take effect for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027. ## The tax base The tax base is estimated using HMRC's Corporation Tax self -assessment data matched with published third-party data. The tax base is adjusted in line with OBR projections for growth in company profits over the forecast horizon. ## Costing The costing for this measure is made up of two components. The first is an estimate of the additional revenue generated by improved efficiency in transfer pricing compliance activity. The second accounts for a behavioural response whereby some multinationals choose to review and correct their transfer pricing policies due to the new reporting requirement. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +25m | +105m | +150m | +245m | +350m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the size of the tax base, the behavioural response, and the magnitude of the efficiencies generated by the measure. ## Vaping Duty Stamps: Introduce a Vaping Duty Stamps scheme alongside Vaping Products Duty from 1 October 2026 ## Measure description This measure introduces the requirement for all products liable for Vaping Products Duty (VPD) to carry a duty stamp on their retail packaging. The stamp will provide a physical and digital tool to identify the product's tax status and indicate its legitimacy. From 1 October 2026, all vaping products must be stamped before they are released for retail sale. From 1 April 2027, any product displayed or sold without a duty stamp is liable to hire seizure and penalties. ## The tax base The tax base is the estimated volume of illicit (non-duty paid) vaping e-liquid. This is calculated by multiplying the projected total volume of e-liquid consumption by the projected illicit market share. ## Costing The costing is estimated by applying the pre- and post-measure tax regimes to the tax base described above. The costing estimates a reduction in the illicit market from vaping duty stamps, resulting in an increase in the size of the duty-paid market. The main impact comes from digital tracing on legitimate supply chains supporting efforts of enforcement agencies and reducing accidental and deliberate non-compliance by retailers. A behavioural adjustment is made to account for a reduction in consumer demand for non-duty paid vaping liquid, and a displacement effect by the illicit market. ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) | | 2025-26 | 2026-27 | 2027-28 | 2028-29 | 2029-30 | 2030-31 | |------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | Exchequer impact | +0m | +5m"}, {"file": "Budget_2025_Policy_Costings.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "| +25m | +25m | +20m | +20m | ## Areas of uncertainty The main uncertainties in this costing relate to the effect of transitional stamps in 2026-27 and the behavioural response of the illicit market. ## Annex A: Indexation in the public finance forecast baseline The following table shows the indexation assumptions that have been included in the public finances forecast baseline, including all pre-announcements, for Budget 2025 policy costings.

Statistical presentation ## 2.1 Data description This is a National Statistics publication produced by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). It provides information on the number of Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs) raising funds, number of VCTs managing funds and the amount of funds raised by VCTs. It also includes the number of individuals claiming Income Tax (IT) relief on their Venture Capital Trust (VCT) investments and the amount of investment on which relief was claimed. VCTs are one of the three tax-based venture capital schemes, introduced in 1995, that were active in the 2023 to 2024 tax year. See further information on VCTs and the policy background (https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/venturecapital-trusts-statistics-introductory-note). National Statistics are accredited official statistics (https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/accredited-official-statistics/). ## 2.2 Classification system For data on funds raised by VCTs (Table 1), the unique name and reference number of the VCT is used to aggregate the data. For the VCT IT relief claimed through Self Assessment returns (Table 2a and 2b), a Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) number, assigned to each individual, is used to aggregate the data. ## 2.3 Sector coverage The funds raised by VCTs are subsequently invested into companies from various sectors in the UK Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 2007 (https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialcla ssificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007). ## 2.4 Statistical concepts and definitions ## Tax year The statistics are aggregated into tax years. A tax year stretches from 6 April until 5 April the following calendar year. ## VCTs raising funds VCTs which have issued shares to investors in the tax year. ## VCTs managing funds VCTs which were active at the end of the associated tax year (5 April). VCTs who have liquidated or merged with other VCTs are excluded from this figure. ## 2.5 Statistical unit The units in the statistics are VCTs raising or managing funds, the amount of funds raised, individuals claiming IT relief on their VCT investments, and the associated amounts invested"}, {"file": "Background quality report: Venture Capital Trusts statistics - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "by these individuals. ## 2.6 Statistical population All VCTs listed on a UK recognised Stock Exchange and individuals who have invested into these VCTs. ## 2.7 Reference area The geographic region covered by the data is the United Kingdom. ## 2.8 Time coverage The statistics in each table of the publication cover different time periods: - Table 1 covers the time periods from tax years 1995 to 1996 to 2023 to 2024 - Table 2a and 2b cover the time periods from tax years 2021 to 2022 to 2023 to 2024 ## 3. Statistical processing ## 3.1 Source data Investments in VCTs are notified to HMRC, but until recently, this was not in a form suitable for data capture. As of May 2024, this publication has utilised HMRC administrative data. Previously, information on the number of VCTs and funds raised were obtained from publicly available internet sources, mainly FE Investegate VCTs information and news announcements (https://www.investegate.co.uk/). Table 1 includes values for the 2019 to 2020 to 2021 to 2022 tax years using both the new and old series. From 2022 to 2023, figures are reported using the new series only. Self Assessment returns are used to collect data on VCT IT relief claimed by investors. This information will not cover investors making IT relief claims through other systems (e.g. PAYE) or not making any claims. ## 3.2 Frequency of data collection The data is collected annually. This year's statistics are based on data extracted in April 2025. ## 3.3 Data collection The value of the funds raised by VCTs is collected using administrative data from the Regulation 21A returns (https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/venture-capitalschemesmanual/vcm58090#:~:text=SI1995%2F1979%20Regulation%2021A,eligible%20shares'% 20in%20the%20year.). The current status of the VCTs is also checked, for example, whether the VCT has liquidated, dissolved or merged. IT relief data is extracted from Self Assessment tax returns received by HMRC. ## 3.4 Data validation Initial checks carried out on the data include: - ensuring that the amount of funds raised has a realistic value - checking that amounts invested on which relief was claimed is within the VCT investment limit (\u00a3200,000) - checking that the VCT corresponds to the correct name to avoid the presence of duplicate VCTs - flagging duplicate records, i.e. any individual VCT records with the same issue date and amount of investment are identified - checking the amount of funds raised are in line between the new series and ## old series for years prior to 2022 to 2023 Once the values are aggregated, any significant changes in figures from one statistical release to the next are investigated. The total funds raised and amount raised by each individual VCT are compared with other data sources such as the FE Investegate VCTs information and news announcements (https://www.investegate.co.uk/), Association of Investment Companies (https://www.theaic.co.uk/) and Wealth Club (https://www.wealthclub.co.uk/). Small discrepancies between the figures can arise due to differences in the methodology and assumptions used to compile the figures. In the case of large discrepancies, this is reported to VCT policy colleagues and further investigation takes place"}, {"file": "Background quality report: Venture Capital Trusts statistics - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "until the discrepancy is understood. ## 3.5 Data compilation ## Dealing with missing data Where there is missing data for VCTs, values are manually supplemented using FE Investegate VCTs information and news announcements (https://www.investegate.co.uk/). Where shares are issued at various prices, an average value is calculated if a breakdown is not available. ## Aggregating data In Table 1, data is aggregated using the unique reference number and name assigned to each VCT. As VCTs can merge with other VCTs, a list is produced comparing the VCTs present to identify these instances and remove any duplicates. Self Assessment data is aggregated using a UTR assigned to each investor. ## 4. Quality Management Our statistical practice is regulated by the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR). OSR sets the standards of trustworthiness, quality, and value in the Code of Practice for Statistics (https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/the-code/) that all producers of official statistics should adhere to. You are welcome to contact us directly with any comments about how we meet these standards by emailing venturecapital.statistics@hmrc.gov.uk. Alternatively, you can contact OSR by emailing regulation@statistics.gov.uk or via the OSR website. The Venture Capital Trust statistics were independently reviewed by OSR in June 2013. They comply with the standards of trustworthiness, quality and value in the Code of Practice for Statistics (https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/) and should be labelled 'accredited official statistics'. Accredited official statistics are called National Statistics in the Statistics and registration Service Act 2007. ## 4.1 Quality assurance All official statistics produced by KAI, must meet the standards in the Code of Practice for Statistics (https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/wpcontent/uploads/2018/02/Code-of-Practice-for-Statistics.pdf) produced by the UK Statistics Authority (UKSA) and all analysts adhere to best practice as set out in the 'Quality' pillar. Analytical Quality Assurance describes the arrangements and procedures put in place to ensure analytical outputs are error free and fit-for-purpose. It is an essential part of KAI's way of working as the complexity of our work and the speed at which we are asked to provide advice means there is a high risk of error which can have serious consequences on KAI's and HMRC's reputation, decisions, and in turn on peoples' lives. Every piece of analysis is unique, and as a result there is no single quality assurance (QA) checklist that contains all the QA tasks needed for every project. Nonetheless, analysts in KAI use a checklist which summarises the key QA tasks and is used as a starting point for teams when they are considering what QA actions to undertake. Teams amend and adapt it as they see fit, to take account of the level of risk associated with their analysis, and the different QA tasks that are relevant to the work. At the start of a project, during the planning stage, analysts and managers make a risk-based decision on what level of QA is required. Analysts and managers construct a plan for all the QA tasks that will need to be completed, along with documentation on how each of those tasks are to be carried out and turn this list into"}, {"file": "Background quality report: Venture Capital Trusts statistics - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "a QA checklist specific to the project. Analysts carry out the QA tasks, update the checklist, and pass onto the Senior Responsible Officer for review and eventual sign off. ## 4.2 Quality assessment The QA for this project adhered to the framework described in '4.1 Quality assurance' and the specific procedures undertaken were as follows: ## Stage 1 - Specifying the question Up to date documentation was agreed with stakeholders setting out: - outputs needed and by when - how the outputs will be used - all parameters required for the analysis ## Stage 2 - Developing the methodology Methodology was agreed and developed in collaboration with stakeholders and others with relevant expertise, ensuring it was fit for purpose and would deliver the required outputs. ## Stage 3 - Building and populating a model/piece of code Stage 3 consists of the following steps: - analysis was produced using the most appropriate software and in line with good practice guidance - data inputs were checked to ensure they were fit-for-purpose by reviewing available documentation and, where possible, through direct contact with data suppliers - QA of the input data was carried out - the analysis was audited by someone other than the lead analyst - checking code and methodology ## Stage 4 - Running and testing the model/code Stage 4 consists of the following: - results were compared with those produced in previous years and differences understood and determined to be genuine - results were determined to be explainable and in line with expectations ## Stage 5 - Drafting the final output The final stage includes the following: - checks were completed to ensure internal consistency (e.g. totals equal the sum of the components) - the final outputs were independently proofread and checked ## 5. Relevance ## 5.1 User needs This analysis is likely to be of interest to users under the following broad headings: - policy makers in government - academia and research bodies - media - venture capital associations - companies receiving investments via VCTs - investors investing in VCTs ## 5.2 User satisfaction HMRC is committed to providing impartial quality statistics which meet our users' needs. We encourage our users to engage with us so that we can improve our National and Official Statistics and identify gaps in our statistics. If you would like to comment on these statistics or have any enquiries, please use the statistical contacts named at the beginning of the report. ## 5.3 Completeness Table 1 includes all funds raised by VCTs and all VCTs which were incorporated since 1995. Prior to the 2019 to 2020 tax year, the funds raised were based on the shares issued as reported on commercial websites. There is a possibility of some share issues not being reported on the websites. Values for funds raised are provided using the FE Investegate VCTs information and news announcements (https://www.investegate.co.uk/) and HMRC administrative data from the Regulation 21A returns for the tax years 2019 to 2020 to 2021 to 2022 for comparison"}, {"file": "Background quality report: Venture Capital Trusts statistics - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "across data series. From 2022 to 2023, funds raised and numbers of VCTs will be reported based on administrative data, with any missing values being supplemented using information on commercial websites. Table 2a and Table 2b include every case captured via Self Assessment returns. There may be VCT investors who claim IT relief outside Self Assessment, and some may not submit any claims. ## 6. Accuracy and reliability ## 6.1 Overall accuracy Accuracy is addressed by eliminating non-sampling errors as much as possible through adherence to the quality assurance framework. The values for tax years prior to 2019 to 2020 in Table 1 are based on data available on commercial websites. These figures are outside the managerial control of HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and are not considered National Statistics. To eliminate errors, we have performed checks with other data sources. The potential sources of error include: - errors in the reporting of share issues on commercial websites - potential human error when manually collecting data from websites - mistakes in the programming code used to analyse the data and produce the statistics ## 6.2 Sampling error As no sampling is necessary, sampling error is not an issue. ## 6.3 Non-sampling error ## Coverage error Table 2a and 2b include every case captured via Self Assessment returns. Therefore, the data only includes investors who have claimed IT relief via Self Assessment forms. ## Measurement error For years prior to tax year 2019 to 2020, figures on the number of shares issued and issue prices could be incorrectly reported on commercial websites. The data are subsequently collected by analysts manually. This is another point at which data may be altered due to human error or software errors. There is a risk that errors involve very large investment amounts. To mitigate this, checks are carried out and any incorrect large values which are detected are investigated (and potentially altered) in the analysis database before the statistics are produced. ## Nonresponse error Nonresponse errors may arise if a VCT does not submit their Regulation 21A return and does not announce an issue of its shares. These errors may also occur if an investor does not make a claim for VCT IT relief. ## Processing error It is possible that errors exist in the programming code used to analyse the data and produce the statistics. This risk is reduced through developing a good understanding of the complexities of venture capital schemes, and thoroughly reviewing and testing the programs that are used. ## 6.4 Data revision ## Data revision - policy The UKSA Code of Practice for Official Statistics requires all producers of Official Statistics to publish transparent guidance on the policy for revisions. VCTs have six months following the end of the tax year to submit their Regulation 21A return. However, there may be a small number of late returns or amendments which can result in minor revisions to the published figures, particularly for the 2023 to 2024 tax year. VCT investors can claim"}, {"file": "Background quality report: Venture Capital Trusts statistics - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "IT relief up to five years after the 31 January following the tax year in which the investment was made. Therefore, in next year's publication, a small number of late claims may result in minor revisions to previously published figures, particularly to the provisional figures for 2023 to 2024. To account for this, we have applied and uplift figure for 2023 to 2024. This uplift factor is based on the percentage increase in returns from the previous year, where we have assumed the number of returns will increase at a similar proportion in next year's release. Therefore, these figures should be treated as provisional and will be subject to revisions in future publications. The figures for 2021 to 2022 and 2022 to 2023 have been revised as a result of more returns being received by HMRC since the last publication. ## Data revision - practice This year, figures for tax years 2019 to 2020 to 2022 to 2023 have been revised in the new series columns of Table 1. Figures prior to 2023 to 2024 have been revised in Tables 2a and 2b. ## 6.5 Seasonal adjustment Seasonal adjustment is not applicable for this analysis. ## 7. Timeliness and punctuality ## 7.1 Timeliness All data including funds raised via VCTs and investors claiming IT relief were published in May 2025: - Table 1 covers funds raised on or before 5 April 2024 - Table 2a and 2b cover returns relating to investments made on or before 5 April 2024 ## 7.2 Punctuality In accordance with the Code of Practice for official statistics, the exact date of publication will be given not less than one calendar month before publication on both the Schedule of updates for HMRC's statistics (https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/schedule-of-updates-for-hmrcs-statistics) and the Research and statistics (https://www.gov.uk/search/research-and-statistics? content_store_document_type=upcoming_statistics) calendar of GOV.UK. Any delays to the publication date will be announced on the Schedule of updates and announcements for HMRC's statistics (https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/schedule-of-updates-for-hmrcs-statistics) webpage. The full publication calendar can be found on both the Schedule of updates for HMRC's statistics (https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/schedule-of-updates-forhmrcs-statistics) and the Research and statistics (https://www.gov.uk/search/researchand-statistics?content_store_document_type=upcoming_statistics) calendar of GOV.UK. ## 8. Coherence and comparability ## 8.1 Geographical comparability This analysis is presented for a single region - the United Kingdom. ## 8.2 Comparability over time There are no changes leading to comparability issues. ## 8.3 Coherence - cross domain The value of funds raised in Table 1 could be different to figures produced by other commercial websites. This is due to differences in methodology and assumptions used to collect HMRC administrative data and the third-party data available online. ## 8.4 Coherence - sub-annual and annual statistics All statistics are presented as annual outputs. No coherence issues exist. ## 8.5 Coherence - internal Rounding of numbers may cause some minor internal coherence issues as the figures within a table may not sum to the total displayed. Effort has been made to ensure totals between tables remain consistent where appropriate.

Accessibility and clarity ## 9.1 News release There were no press releases linked to this data over the past year. ## 9.2 Publication The tables and associated commentary are published on the Venture Capital Trusts statistics (https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/venture-capital-trustsstatistics) webpage of GOV.UK. The tables and associated commentary are published in HTML. The document complies with the accessibility regulations set out in the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/852/contents/made). Further information can be found in HMRC's accessible documents policy (https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/about/accessibledocuments-policy). ## 9.3 Online databases This analysis is not used in any online databases. ## 9.4 Micro-data access Access to this data is not possible in micro-data form, due to HMRC's responsibilities around maintaining confidentiality of taxpayer and VCT information. ## 9.5 Other No other dissemination formats are available for this analysis. ## 9.6 Documentation on methodology All up-to-date information on the methodology is found on this webpage. ## 9.7 Quality documentation All official statistics produced by KAI, must meet the standards in the Code of Practice for Statistics (https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/the-code/) produced by the UKSA and all analysts adhere to best practice as set out in the 'Quality' pillar. Information about quality procedures for this analysis can be found in section 4 of this document. ## 10. Cost and burden Funds raised by VCTs, and investor level data is obtained from an administrative data source. Thus, there is no additional burden on companies or HMRC tax inspectors to provide information. Effort has been made to automate the production of statistics to some extent and utilise administrative data, increasing the efficiency of the process in forthcoming years. It is estimated to take about 60 days full-time equivalent (FTE) to produce the annual analysis and publication. ## 11. Confidentiality ## 11.1 Confidentiality - policy HMRC has a legal duty to maintain the confidentiality of taxpayer information. Section 18(1) of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 (CRCA) (https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/11/section/18) sets out our duty of confidentiality. This analysis complies with this requirement. ## 11.2 Confidentiality - data treatment The statistics in these tables are presented at an aggregate level so identification of individual companies is minimised, but potentially still possible. Where potential risks exist, statistical disclosure control (SDC) is applied to cells within tables. SDC is the application of methods to ensure confidential data is not disclosed to parties who don't have authority to access it. SDC modifies data so that the risk of data subjects being identified is within acceptable limits while making the data as useful as possible. Disclosure in this analysis is avoided by applying rules that prevent categories of data containing: - small numbers of contributors - small numbers of contributors which are very dominant If a cell within a table is"}, {"file": "Background quality report: Venture Capital Trusts statistics - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "determined to be disclosive, its contents are suppressed either by removing the data or combining categories.

It also reduces VCT Income Tax relief rate for individuals investing in VCTs. ## Policy objective Extending the EIS and VCT limits increases the real-terms generosity of the schemes. This continues to provide support to new and early-stage companies, as well as those scaling up. The reduction in the Income Tax relief rate for the VCT scheme is designed to better balance the amount of upfront tax relief compared to EIS, which does not offer dividend relief, and incentivising funds to seek out higher returns, to ensure they are targeting the highest growth companies. ## Background to the measure At Autumn Budget 2024, the government committed to creating a positive environment for entrepreneurship and working with leading entrepreneurs and venture capital firms to understand how policy supports that, including the role of the existing tax schemes. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date The measure will take effect from 6 April 2026. ## Current law The current EIS legislation is contained in Part 5 of the Income Tax Act (ITA) 2007. The current VCT legislation is contained in Part 6 ITA 2007. ## Proposed revisions Legislation will be introduced in Finance Bill 2025-26 to amend Parts 5 and 6 of ITA 2007 to the following: - Sections 186 and 297 ITA2007 will be amended to increase the gross assets requirement that a company must not exceed for the EIS and VCT to \u00a330 million (from \u00a315 million) immediately before the issue of the shares or securities, and \u00a335 million (from \u00a316 million) immediately after the issue - Sections 173A and 292A ITA 2007 will be amended to increase the annual investment limit that companies can raise to \u00a310 million (from \u00a35 million) and for knowledge-intensive companies to \u00a320 million (from \u00a310 million) -"}, {"file": "Venture Capital Trusts, Enterprise Investment Scheme investment limit increase and restructure - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "Sections 173AA, 173AB, 292AA and 292AB ITA 2007 will be amended to increases the company's lifetime investment limit to \u00a324 million (from \u00a312 million) and for knowledge-intensive companies to \u00a340 million (from \u00a320 million) - Section 263 ITA 2007 will be amended to reduce the Income Tax relief that can be claimed by an individual investing in VCT to 20% from the current rate of 30% The increases to the annual, lifetime and gross asset limits apply only to qualifying companies that are not registered in Northern Ireland trading in goods or the generation, transmission, distribution, supply, wholesale trade or crossborder exchange of electricity. These companies will remain eligible for the current scheme limits. ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3 million) | 2025 to 2026 | 2026 to 2027 | 2027 to 2028 | 2028 to 2029 | 2029 to 2030 | 2030 to 2031 | |----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------| | Nil | Nil | +65 | +50 | +45 | +45 | These figures include the fiscal impact of 2 measures: - Venture Capital Schemes: Increase the Venture Capital Trust (VCT) scheme and the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) annual and lifetime investment limits and the gross assets test from 6 April 2026 - Venture Capital Schemes: Reduce the VCT scheme Income Tax relief from 6 April 2026 These 2 measures have been costed separately and the figures are set out in Table 4.1 of Budget 2025 and have been certified by the Office for Budget Responsibility. More details can be found in the policy costings document published alongside Budget 2025. ## Macroeconomic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. ## Impact on individuals, households and families This measure will impact around 24,000 individuals, who will receive less Income Tax relief on their VCT investments. There is expected to be no impact on individuals' experience of dealing with HMRC, as this measure does not change or introduce any tax obligations or processes. The measure is not expected to impact on households, family formation, stability or breakdown. ## Equalities impacts An individual may be affected by this measure regardless of their protected characteristics. If a protected group is overrepresented in this population, then it will be disproportionately impacted. The population that invests in VCTs is estimated to have an overrepresentation of males (76%) compared to their prevalence in the UK adult population (50%). In addition, it is estimated there is an overrepresentation of those aged 45 to 64 (57%) compared to the UK adult population (31%). HMRC does not currently hold data on the other protected characteristics of individuals impacted by this measure and so cannot make an assessment of the impacts on those with shared protected characteristics. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations This measure will benefit businesses using the scheme, allowing them to access further investment through the schemes. It is expected to have a negligible administrative impact on businesses who raise capital via the EIS or VCT, fund managers and other"}, {"file": "Venture Capital Trusts, Enterprise Investment Scheme investment limit increase and restructure - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "promoters and advisers using or associated with the EIS and VCTs, by increasing the existing annual, lifetime and gross asset limits and so widening access to and usage of the scheme. It will particularly impact the estimated several hundred businesses that are close to these limits. One-off costs are expected to include familiarisation with the changes. There are not expected to be any continuing costs. Customer experience is expected to remain broadly the same as this measure does not change how businesses interact with HMRC. There are not expected to be any impacts on civil society organisations. ## Operational impact (\u00a3 million) (HMRC or other) HMRC will need to make some changes to IT systems to implement these changes. The costs are estimated at \u00a31.7 million. There are no costs that are expected in updating the guidance. ## Other impacts Other impacts have been considered and none have been identified. ## Monitoring and evaluation The measure will be monitored and assessed alongside other measures in the government's package for entrepreneurship. ## Further advice If you have any questions about this change, contact ## venturecapitalschemes.policy@hmrc.gov.uk.

This publication is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advance-tax-certaintyservice-major-investment-projects-with-certainty-in-advance/advance-tax-certainty-service ## Who is likely to be affected Taxpayers who plan to invest \u00a31 billion or more in the UK over the lifetime of a project, and in doing so want to apply for advance certainty on its expected taxation. ## General description of the measure The government is introducing a dedicated service in HMRC to provide major investment projects with certainty on the application of tax law to their specific circumstances. This includes Corporation Tax, VAT, Stamp taxes, PAYE and operation of Construction Industry Scheme. This measure will ensure that HMRC can provide statutory clearances as part of this service. ## Policy objective This measure contributes to the government's objective to deliver a stable and transparent tax environment by reducing tax uncertainty for major UK investment projects. It responds to calls from industry for clarity by providing binding tax certainty for major project investments, demonstrating the government's commitment to boosting long term economic growth in the UK. ## Background to the measure In the Corporate Tax Roadmap published at Autumn Budget 2024, the Chancellor announced a consultation on a new service from HMRC to offer 'advance tax certainty' to major investment projects in the UK. The original details were set out in the Corporate Tax Roadmap (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/corporate-tax-roadmap-2024). The consultation (https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/advance-tax-certainty- for-major-projects-consultation) opened on 31 March and concluded on 17 June. At Budget 2025, the government published a summary of responses to this consultation. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date The service will open in July 2026. ## Current law As a new service, there is no specific extant legislation. Legislation will be introduced in the Finance Bill 2025-26. ## Proposed revisions Legislation will be introduced in Finance Bill 2025-26 which will give HMRC the power to issue a clearance on the application of Corporation Tax, VAT, Stamp Taxes, PAYE and operation of Construction Industry Scheme to certain project expenditure. Qualifying project expenditure must be at least \u00a31 billion. Subject to full initial disclosure of all material facts, a clearance will bind HMRC for five years and may be renewed for a further five years - unless a material change in the law, or court decision that clarifies its application, means that the prior clearance is no"}, {"file": "Advance tax certainty service - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "longer correct. ## Summary of impacts Exchequer impact (\u00a3 million) | 2025 to 2026 | 2026 to 2027 | 2027 to 2028 | 2028 to 2029 | 2029 to 2030 | 2030 to 2031 | |----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------| | nil | nil | nil | nil | nil | nil | This measure is not expected to have an Exchequer impact. ## Macroeconomic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. ## Impact on individuals, households and families There is no impact on individuals as this measure only affects businesses. ## Equalities impacts This measure only affects businesses, therefore it is not anticipated there will be disproportionate impacts on those in groups sharing protected characteristics. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations This measure impacts businesses who plan to invest \u00a31 billion in the UK over the lifetime of a project and want to apply for a clearance through HMRC's dedicated service. The certainty provided is expected to benefit these businesses. This measure is expected to have a negligible impact on administrative burdens for businesses who apply for the service. One-off costs could include businesses needing to familiarise themselves with the changes. Continuing costs could include maintaining additional records. This measure is expected overall to impact businesses experience of dealing with HMRC as it provides eligible customers with a clear upfront position on how it intends to apply tax rules to material aspects of an investment project. This measure is not expected to impact civil society organisations. ## Operational impact (\u00a3 million) (HMRC or other) HMRC operational impacts for this change will result in further staff costs which are estimated to be \u00a34.1 million over the scorecard period and may incur additional IT costs estimated to be \u00a31.6 million. ## Other impacts Other impacts have been considered, and none have been identified. ## Monitoring and evaluation Consideration will be given to monitoring this measure through information collected from both internal stakeholders and external business feedback surveys and kept under review through a planned review period. ## Further advice If you have any questions about this change, contact HMRC by email advancetaxcertainty@hmrc.gov.uk.

It will also affect the qualifying new resident employee for whom an employer operates PAYE on a proportion of their income. ## General description of the measure When employers submit a PAYE notification form to HMRC on behalf of a qualifying new resident, the measure will require employers to check if the proportion of income they want to exclude from PAYE exceeds 30%. If it does, it will require them to limit the in-year relief provided to no more than 30% of the employee's income. ## Policy objective Limiting the in-year relief to no more than 30% for OWR eligible employees should ensure in most cases that the provisional relief received in year does not exceed the OWR relief that the employee is able to claim when they file their tax return. This aligns with the wider intent of PAYE, which is, as far as practicable and without placing undue administrative burden on an employer, to collect the right amount of the employee's income tax liability on their PAYE income when it is paid. ## Background to the measure This measure was announced at Budget 2025 to reform the taxation of non-UK domiciled individuals introduced on 6 April 2025. Qualifying new residents who work both in the UK and overseas will be eligible to claim OWR when they file their Self Assessment tax return form at the end of the tax year. Section 690 provisions were introduced as part of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 which came into force on 6 April 2003. These provisions permitted employers to provide provisional in-year relief by submitting a PAYE notification form to notify HMRC that they are not going to operate PAYE on the proportion of income that relates to overseas duties. Since 6 April 2025, OWR has been subject to a"}, {"file": "Aligning PAYE notifications with the Overseas Workday Relief limit - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "financial limit on the amount of relief that can be claimed, this is the lower of \u00a3300,000 or 30% of an individual's total employment income. This financial limit is currently only applied when the employee makes their OWR claim on their Self Assessment tax return. In addition, the Section 690 application process was digitised, and a new PAYE notification form became available from 6 April 2025. This form can be used by employers to obtain provisional in-year relief for globally mobile employees who are non-UK resident, eligible to split year treatment, qualifying new residents eligible for OWR or treaty non-UK residents. This measure only affects employees who are qualifying new residents eligible for OWR. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date The measure will take effect from 6 April 2026. ## Current law The current law regarding the OWR financial limit is contained in Section 41R of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003. The provisions relating to PAYE notifications for globally mobile employees are found in s.690-s.690E of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003. ## Proposed revisions We will amend the Section 690 legislation to specify that, if the employer's best estimate of qualifying employment income for an eligible employee is more than 30%, it must be limited to 30% on the PAYE notification form. ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3 million) | 2025 to 2026 | 2026 to 2027 | 2027 to 2028 | 2028 to 2029 | 2029 to 2030 | 2030 to 2031 | |----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------| | Nil | Nil | Nil | Nil | Nil | Nil | This measure is not expected to have an Exchequer impact. ## Marcoeconomic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. ## Impact on individuals, households and families This measure could impact up to an estimated 9,600 employees who are eligible to claim OWR. However, in practice, most OWR claimants do not use the Section 690 process to obtain in-year relief, so the number of impacted individuals will be less than the total OWR estimate. Those individuals who wish to benefit from provisional in-year relief can ask their employer to submit a PAYE notification form on their behalf. Not all OWR claimants will opt to receive provisional in-year relief and of those that do, not all will use the Section 690 process to do so. This measure ensures that those individuals who do use the Section 690 process do not receive more in-year relief than they will be able to claim at the tax year end, via Self Assessment. The measure is not expected to impact on family formation, stability or breakdown. ## Equalities impacts HMRC does not hold data on the population likely to take up OWR, however non-domiciled individuals affected by the broader package of reforms are likely to be represented in each of the groups sharing protected characteristics. Where protected groups are overrepresented in either the eligible or ineligible populations, the measure will have a disproportionate impact on"}, {"file": "Aligning PAYE notifications with the Overseas Workday Relief limit - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "that group. At Autumn Budget 2024 it was estimated that males (70%), and people aged 35 to 54 (55%) are overrepresented in the population impacted by this measure compared to the UK population where 49% are male and 25% are aged 35 to 54. HMRC does not hold data on any other protected characteristics of individuals impacted by this measure and so cannot make an assessment of the impacts on those with shared protected characteristics. However, due to the nature of the non-domiciled policy there will be an overrepresentation of non-UK nationalities impacted by this measure both in the eligible and ineligible groups. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations This measure will have a negligible impact on an estimated 800 to 1200 businesses who provide in-year relief to eligible employees. In future, they will not be able to include a proportion higher than 30% on the PAYE notification form. One-off costs could include businesses needing to familiarise themselves with the changes. There are not expected to be any further one-off or any continuing costs. This measure is not expected to impact on businesses experience of dealing with HMRC as it does not alter how businesses would interact with HMRC, This measure is not expected to impact on civil society organisations. ## Operational impact (\u00a3 million) (HMRC or other) This measure will not require any new changes to IT systems or impact staff resources and, as such, HMRC do not anticipate any operational impacts. ## Other impacts Other impacts have been considered and none have been identified. ## Monitoring and evaluation This measure will be monitored via analysis of information collected from PAYE notification forms and Self Assessment tax returns. ## Further advice If you have any questions about this change, contact the PAYE Policy Team at ## payepolicyteam@hmrc.gov.uk.

It also reduces VCT Income Tax relief rate for individuals investing in VCTs. ## Policy objective Extending the EIS and VCT limits increases the real-terms generosity of the schemes. This continues to provide support to new and early-stage companies, as well as those scaling up. The reduction in the Income Tax relief rate for the VCT scheme is designed to better balance the amount of upfront tax relief compared to EIS, which does not o ff er dividend relief, and incentivising funds to seek out higher returns, to ensure they are targeting the highest growth companies. ## Background to the measure At Autumn Budget 2024, the government committed to creating a positive environment for entrepreneurship and working with leading entrepreneurs and venture capital firms to understand how policy supports that, including the role of the existing tax schemes. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date The measure will take e ff ect from 6 April 2026. ## Current law The current EIS legislation is contained in Part 5 of the Income Tax Act (ITA) 2007. The current VCT legislation is contained in Part 6 ITA 2007. ## Proposed revisions Legislation will be introduced in Finance Bill 2025-26 to amend Parts 5 and 6 of ITA 2007 to the following: - Sections 186 and 297 ITA2007 will be amended to increase the gross assets requirement that a company must not exceed for the EIS and VCT to \u00a330 million (from \u00a315 million) immediately before the issue of the shares or securities, and \u00a335 million (from \u00a316 million) immediately after the issue - Sections 173A and 292A ITA 2007 will be amended to increase the annual investment limit that companies can raise to \u00a310 million (from \u00a35 million) and for knowledge-intensive companies to \u00a320 million (from \u00a310 million) - Sections 173AA, 173AB, 292AA and 292AB ITA 2007 will be amended to increases the company's lifetime investment limit to \u00a324 million (from \u00a312 million) and for knowledge-intensive companies to \u00a340 million (from \u00a320 million) - Section 263 ITA 2007 will be amended to reduce the Income Tax relief that can be claimed by an individual investing in VCT to 20% from the current rate of"}, {"file": "Venture Capital Trusts, Enterprise Investment Scheme investment limit increase and restructure - GOV.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "30% The increases to the annual, lifetime and gross asset limits apply only to qualifying companies that are not registered in Northern Ireland trading in goods or the generation, transmission, distribution, supply, wholesale trade or cross-border exchange of electricity.

More details can be found in the policy costings document published alongside Budget 2025. ## Macroeconomic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. ## Impact on individuals, households and families This measure will impact around 24,000 individuals, who will receive less Income Tax relief on their VCT investments. There is expected to be no impact on individuals' experience of dealing with HMRC, as this measure does not change or introduce any tax obligations or processes. The measure is not expected to impact on households, family formation, stability or breakdown. ## Equalities impacts An individual may be a ff ected by this measure regardless of their protected characteristics. If a protected group is overrepresented in this population, then it will be disproportionately impacted. The population that invests in VCTs is estimated to have an overrepresentation of males (76%) compared to their prevalence in the UK adult population (50%). In addition, it is estimated there is an overrepresentation of those aged 45 to 64 (57%) compared to the UK adult population (31%). HMRC does not currently hold data on the other protected characteristics of individuals impacted by this measure and so cannot make an assessment of the impacts on those with shared protected characteristics. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations This measure will benefit businesses using the scheme, allowing them to access further investment through the schemes. It is expected to have a negligible administrative impact on businesses who raise capital via the EIS or VCT, fund managers and other promoters and advisers using or associated with the EIS and VCTs, by increasing the existing annual, lifetime and gross asset limits and so widening access to and usage of the scheme. It will particularly impact the estimated several hundred businesses that are close to these limits. One-o ff costs are expected to include familiarisation with the changes.

Main points and summary ## 1.1 Enterprise Investment Scheme In the tax year 2022 to 2023, 4,205 companies raised a total of \u00a31,957 million of funds under the EIS scheme. Funding has decreased by 15% from 2021 to 2022, the previous year, when 4,455 companies raised \u00a32,297 million. Investment in 2022 to 2023 saw a reduction down to average levels seen prior to the previous year's increase, which was itself a rebound from the pandemic. Around \u00a3436 million of investment was raised by 1,280 new EIS companies in 2022 to 2023. In 2022 to 2023, companies from the Information and Communication sector accounted for \u00a3660 million of investment (34% of all EIS investment). Companies registered in London and the South East accounted for the largest proportion of investment, raising \u00a31,280 million (65% of all EIS investment) in 2022 to 2023. ## 1.2 Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme In 2022 to 2023, 1,815 companies raised a total of \u00a3157 million of funds under the SEIS scheme. Funding in 2022 to 2023 has decreased by 24% from 2021 to 2022 when 2,295 companies raised \u00a3207 million. Around 1,440 of the companies were raising funds under the SEIS scheme for the first time in 2022 to 2023, representing \u00a3137 million of investment. In 2022 to 2023, companies from the Information and Communication sector accounted for \u00a362 million (39% of all SEIS investment). Companies registered in London and the South East accounted for the largest proportion of investment, raising \u00a3102 million (65% of SEIS investment) in 2022 to 2023. ## 1.3 Social Investment Tax Relief In 2022 to 2023, 40 social enterprises received investment through the Social Investment Tax Relief (SITR) scheme, and \u00a35.9 million of funds were raised. Funding has remained consistent from 2021 to 2022, when 40 enterprises raised \u00a35.5 million. 2022 to 2023 was the last year that enterprises could raise investment through SITR due to the closure of the scheme for new investment from April 2023. ## 1.4 Advance assurance requests ## EIS In 2023 to 2024, 3,130 AAR applications for EIS were received and 2,290 (73%) have been approved so far. The number of applications has"}, {"file": "Enterprise Investment Scheme, Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme and Social Investment Tax Relief statistics: 2024 - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "decreased from 2022 to 2023 when 3,665 AAR applications were received and 2,960 (81%) approved. ## SEIS In 2023 to 2024, 2,725 AAR applications for SEIS were received and 2,185 (80%) have been approved so far. The number of applications has decreased from 2022 to 2023, when 2,835 AAR applications were received and 2,320 (82%) approved. ## SITR In 2023 to 2024, no AAR applications for SITR were received due to the closure of the scheme for new investment in April 2023. ## 2. Introduction ## 2.1 About these statistics This is a National Statistics publication produced by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). It provides information on the number of companies raising funds, the number of subscriptions and the amounts raised through the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) and Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS). National Statistics are accredited official statistics (https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/accredited-official-statistics/). It also includes Official Statistics on social enterprises raising funds through the Social Investment Tax Relief (SITR) scheme. The EIS, SEIS and SITR are 3 of 4 tax-based venture capital schemes that were active in the 2022 to 2023 tax year, the other being the Venture Capital Trust (VCT) scheme. The current release includes the first estimates for 2022 to 2023. The figures for 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022 include small revisions and minor updates, arising from the receipt of a small number of further EIS1 and SEIS1 forms for these years. Companies have a period of 3 years after shares are issued to submit a compliance statement. Figures from 2021 to 2022 onwards have been uplifted to take account of late returns submitted by companies. Thus, these figures should be treated as provisional and will be subject to revisions in future publications. The publication also provides information on the industrial and geographical breakdown of EIS and SEIS companies, the distribution of companies by the amounts of funds raised, and the distribution of investors by the size of their investment. Section 1 summarises the main statistical points; Sections 3, 4, and 5 presents an overview of the statistics and discusses recent trends. In Section 6, this release includes figures for advance assurance requests received by HMRC. As part of the qualifying process for seeking investment through the schemes, companies can provide a return to HMRC in advance of a share issue to check that it will meet the qualifying conditions for these conditions for these schemes. The statistical tables are included on the main publication page. The next release is planned to be in Spring 2025. People interested in this publication may also be interested in the National Statistics publication on Venture Capital Trusts (VCT) (https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/venture-capital-trusts-statistics). ## 3. Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) ## 3.1 EIS: Number of EIS companies and amount of investment The number of companies raising funds and the level of investment have shown similar trends since the EIS was introduced. In 2022 to 2023 the number of companies raising funds decreased to 4,205, raising a total of \u00a31,957 million. This is most likely a result"}, {"file": "Enterprise Investment Scheme, Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme and Social Investment Tax Relief statistics: 2024 - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "of rising interest rates and some natural reduction following the record breaking year in 2021 to 2022. Overall, there has been a steady increase in EIS use since 2010, due in part to a sustained period of historically low interest rates, increasing promotion and the involvement of fund managers. Additionally, users have responded to a series of legislative changes, notably in 2014, 2015 and 2018, introduced to ensure the focus is on investment in earlystage companies that have the intention to grow and develop in the longer term. In 2020 to 2021, there was a decrease in the number of companies raising funds under the EIS (10%), with the amount raised by EIS companies also dropping by 12% compared to the previous year. The Covid-19 pandemic is likely to have reduced investment through the first 3 quarters of tax year 2020 to 2021. However, funding rebounded in the last quarter of 2020 to 2021 with amounts being raised above pre-pandemic levels for the equivalent period. This trend continued into 2021 to 2022 where the strong rebound into investment saw both the number of companies raising funds and the total amount raised through the EIS exceeding the previous record limits set in 2017 to 2018 and 2019 to 2020. ## Figure 1: Number of companies raising funds and amount raised, 1993-94 to 2022-23 ## 3.2 EIS: New investment The proportion of investment into new companies compared to that for companies raising further funding has declined since the peaks in 2014 to 2015. This coincides with the investment in renewable energy and the progressive exclusion of these activities from the EIS, as noted above. In 2018 to 2019, there was a large drop in funds raised by new companies with only 28% of funding being raised by companies using the EIS for the first time. This trend has continued with 22% of the total amount being raised by new EIS companies in 2022 to 2023. This is likely to be due to the introduction of the riskto-capital condition which places further restrictions on the qualification of investment under the EIS. These restrictions were introduced to ensure that investment under the EIS is genuinely at risk and is made with the intention of providing long-term growth and development of the company's trade. Those low-risk and limited growth investment arrangements targeted by the new condition typically involved the creation of new companies raising funds for the first time. A proportion of this investment was expected to be reinvested elsewhere and, with the new incentives to invest in knowledge intensive companies, this has resulted in increased investment in these companies. Figure 2: Amount of funds raised under the EIS by new companies and old companies, 1993-94 to 2022-23 ## 3.3 EIS: Industry Sector In 2022 to 2023, companies from top 4 sectors (the Manufacturing, the Wholesale and Retail Trade, Repairs, the Information and Communication, the Professional, Scientific and Technical sectors) together accounted for around \u00a31,447 million of investment and made up 75% of all EIS"}, {"file": "Enterprise Investment Scheme, Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme and Social Investment Tax Relief statistics: 2024 - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "Investment. This proportion is a slight increase compared with 2021 to 2022. Figure 3 compares the proportion of investment across sectors, by amount raised under the EIS between 2021 to 2022 and 2022 to 2023. The trends for the 2 years are similar, with an increase in the Professional, Scientific and Technical sector but a decrease in the Financial and Insurance sector. Figure 3: Comparison between amounts of funds raised under the EIS by different industry sectors, 2021-22 to 2022-23 The sector breakdowns in this section are based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 2007. ## 3.4 EIS: Size of investment per company The distribution of the number of companies raising funds under the EIS by investment size differs from the distribution of amount of funds raised by size of investment. In 2022 to 2023, around 4% of EIS companies raised 27% of all investment (investments over \u00a32 million). It is likely that the risk-to-capital condition will have affected these higher investment categories in particular. Since 2012 to 2013 the annual limit on investment has been \u00a35 million. From 2018 to 2019 onwards this has been increased to \u00a310 million for KICs. Figure 4: Distribution of the proportion of funds raised under the EIS by investment band, 2022 to 2023 ## 3.5 EIS: Geographical region of company registration The proportion of the amount of investment in companies with a registered office in London and the South East was 65% in 2022 to 2023. This proportion is similar to recent years. ## Figure 5: Distribution of the number of EIS companies and amount of investment by location, 2022 to 2023 ## 3.6 EIS: Investors claiming Income Tax relief under EIS The number of investors claiming Income Tax relief on Self Assessment forms under the EIS has decreased, from 44,810 in tax year 2021 to 2022 to 40,485 in 2022 to 2023. The total tax relief claimed under EIS decreased overall in 2022 to 2023 and there was a decrease in the total number of investors (10%). In 2018 to 2019, new limits were introduced for investments in KICs. These allow individuals to invest up to \u00a32 million in a year if they are investing in a KIC. There were 50 investments of between \u00a31 million and \u00a32 million in 2022 to 2023, contributing \u00a381 million of investment. With the higher limit available, investments of over \u00a3500,000 comprised 18% of the total amount of EIS investment raised on which claims were made in 2022 to 2023. Figure 6: Proportion of investors and amount of investment, by size of investment (investment on which Income Tax relief was claimed), 2022-23 Total figures provided on the amount of investment on which Income Tax relief was claimed are not directly comparable with the figures on the amount of investment reported by companies. Some investors may choose to offset the tax liability against the previous year. A small amount of relief would also be claimed through the PAYE system; this is assumed to relate to about 5%"}, {"file": "Enterprise Investment Scheme, Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme and Social Investment Tax Relief statistics: 2024 - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "of total EIS investment. ## 4. Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme ## 4.1 SEIS: Number of SEIS companies and amount of investment In 2022 to 2023, the number of companies raising investment under SEIS was 1,815, compared to 2,295 in the previous year. The amount raised by these companies decreased by 24% to \u00a3157 million compared to \u00a3207 million in the previous year. It is likely that increasing interest rates have had a larger impact on SEIS investment than other schemes due to the younger higher risk nature of the companies raising funds through the scheme and investors possibly switching to fixed income investments which offered higher or more stable rates of return. The risk-to-capital condition introduced a requirement for growth and development to the SEIS for the first time in 2018 to 2019, and it is expected that this will have had a short-term impact before the industry adjusted. Figure 7: Number of companies raising funds and amount raised, 2012-13 to 2022-23 ## 4.2 SEIS: New investment The number of new companies raising SEIS funds in tax year 2022 to 2023 decreased by around 22% from the previous year, and the amount raised by these companies also decreased by 24%. Figure 8: Amount of funds raised by new and old SEIS companies, 2012-13 to 2022-23 ## 4.3 SEIS: Industry sector In 2022 to 2023, companies from just one sector (the Information and Communication) accounted for \u00a362 million of investment, which makes up 39% of the amount of SEIS investment received. The next 3 largest sectors (the Professional, Scientific and Technical, the Manufacturing, the Wholesale and Retail Trade, Repairs sectors) together account for 35% of investment. The proportion of SEIS investment by industry sector in 2022 to 2023 has remained consistent in the Information and Communication sector and increased in the Manufacturing sector, compared to the previous year. ## Figure 9: Comparison between the proportion of funds raised under the SEIS by different industry sectors, 2021-22 to 2022-23 ## 4.4 SEIS: Size of investment per company Most companies receive investments of over \u00a350,000 through the SEIS (67% in 2022 to 2023). In 2022 to 2023, around 41% of companies raised amounts over \u00a3100,000, compared to 44% in 2021 to 2022. ## Figure 10: The percentage distribution of funds raised under the SEIS by investment band, 2022-23 ## 4.5 SEIS: Geographical region of company registration The largest proportion of funds raised under the SEIS were through companies with a registered office in London and the South East. In 2022 to 2023, these regions accounted for 65% of the total SEIS investment (Figure 11), which is slightly lower than the previous year (67%). ## Figure 11: The percentage distribution of the number of SEIS companies and amount of investment by location, 2022-23 ## 4.6 SEIS: Investors claiming Income Tax relief under SEIS In 2022 to 2023, 8,065 investors claimed Income Tax relief on Self Assessment forms for the SEIS, compared to 9,900 investors in 2021 to 2022.

Social Investment Tax Relief ## 5.1 Number of social enterprises and amount of investment In 2022 to 2023, 40 social enterprises received investment through the Social Investment Tax Relief (SITR) scheme and \u00a35.9 million of funds were raised. Funds are raised through equity investment (shares) and debt investment (loans). Funding has remained consistent compared with the previous year, where 40 social enterprises raised \u00a35.5 million. In 2017, the amount of investment younger qualifying social enterprises could raise through SITR was increased to \u00a31.5 million. At the same time, restrictions on employee numbers and qualifying trades were introduced to make sure the scheme continued to comply with state aid requirements and was well targeted. Among the amendments was the exclusion of activities such as asset leasing, lending, and operating nursing and residential care homes. 2022 to 2023 was the last year during which enterprises could raise investment through SITR due to the closure of the scheme for new investment in April 2023. Figure 13: Number of companies raising funds and amount raised, 2014-15 to 2022-23 ## 6. Advance assurance requests Companies considering using the EIS, SEIS or SITR can obtain advance assurance (AA) that HMRC will regard the shares to be issued as satisfying the requirements of the scheme. These statistics show the number of companies seeking advance assurance, the number of AAR applications received, and, of these, how many were approved, rejected, or not pursued further. Statistics are presented from 2006 to 2007 for the EIS, 2012 to 2013 for the SEIS and 2014 to 2015 for SITR. ## 6.1 EIS: Number of AARs received and outcomes In 2023 to 2024, HMRC received 3,130 advance assurance applications for the EIS, a decrease of 535 from 2022 to 2023. A number of the applications for 2023 to 2024 are still being processed, but as of March 2024, 73% have been approved so far.

The following are to be increased: - The ceiling that applies to the investment a company can raise in the relevant period and on which investors can claim relief - from \u00a3150,000 to \u00a3250,000. - The limit that applies at the date of investment on the 'gross assets' a company can have - from \u00a3200,000 to \u00a3350,000. - The age limit that applies to the definition of a company's 'new qualifying trade' at the date of investment - from 2 years to 3 years - The annual limits that apply to the investment amount on which individuals can claim income tax and CGT re-investment reliefs - from \u00a3100,000 to \u00a3200,000 ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3m) 2022 to 2023 to 2024 to 2025 to 2026 to 2027 to | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | |--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------| | - | Nil | -25 |"}, {"file": "Increasing the limits of the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "-20 | -20 | -20 | These figures were set out in Table 5.1 of Autumn Statement 2022 and have been certified by the Office for Budget Responsibility. More details can be found in the policy costings document published alongside Autumn Statement 2022. Updated estimates consistent with Spring Budget 2023 forecasts can be found in Table 4.2 of Spring Budget 2023. ## Economic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. Behavioural impacts will include increased seeking of investment by seed-stage companies and increased investment from individual investors as a result of increasing the investment limits. ## Impact on individuals, households and families This measure is expected to impact around 9,000 individuals who invest in companies using the SEIS. The changes will increase the amounts they will be able to invest and on which tax reliefs can be claimed as well as expanding the pool of companies they can invest in. It is not expected to impact on family formation stability or breakdown. Customer experience is expected to remain broadly the same as this measure does not change how individuals interact with HMRC. The measure is not expected to impact on family formation, stability or breakdown. ## Equalities impacts It is not expected that there will be adverse effects on any group sharing protected characteristics. ## Impact on business including civil society organisations This measure is expected to have a positive impact on around 2,000 businesses who raise capital via the SEIS annually. The measure will impact businesses, fund managers and other promoters and advisers using or associated with the SEIS by increasing the limits and so widening access to and usage of the scheme. This measure is expected to have a negligible impact on business administrative costs of familiarisation with the changes. There are not expected to be any continuing costs. Customer experience is expected to remain broadly the same as this measure does not change how businesses interact with HMRC. There are not expected to be any impacts on civil society organisations. ## Operational impact (\u00a3m) (HMRC or other) HMRC will need to make some changes to IT systems to implement these changes and there will be some additional staff costs to administer the new rules. These costs are expected to be in the region of \u00a3800,000. ## Other impacts Other impacts have been considered and none have been identified. ## Monitoring and evaluation This measure will be monitored through information collected from the statutory Compliance Statements submitted by companies using the SEIS. ## Further advice If you have any questions about this change, please contact the Venture Capital Schemes policy team by email: venturecapitalschemes.policy@hmrc.gov.uk.

The rates for the 2027 to 2028 tax year will be - the property basic rate at 22% - the property higher rate at 42% - the property additional rate at 47% This will apply to England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The government will engage with the devolved governments of Scotland and Wales to provide them with the ability to set property income rates in line with their current Income Tax powers in their fiscal frameworks. ## Savings rates measure: The tax rates for savings income will increase from April 2027. The rates for the 2027 to 2028 tax year will be: - the savings basic rate at 22% - the savings higher rate at 42% - the savings additional rate at 47% These rates apply across the UK. ## Dividend rates measure: The tax rates for dividend income will increase from April 2026. The rates for the 2026 to 2027 tax year will be: - the dividend ordinary rate at 10.75% - the dividend upper rate at 35.75% - the dividend additional rate will remain at 39.35% These rates apply across the UK. ## Use of Allowances and Reliefs From April 2027, the Income Tax calculation rules will be changed so that reliefs and allowances will only be applied to property, savings and dividend income after they have been applied to other sources of income. ## Policy objective The government is raising rates of tax on savings, dividend and property income to ensure income from assets is taxed more fairly. Those with property, savings or dividend income pay less tax than those whose income comes from employment or self-employment as they do not pay National Insurance. The government is increasing taxes on property, savings and dividend income, to narrow"}, {"file": "Income Tax \u2014 Changes to Tax rates for Property, Savings and Dividend Income - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "this gap between tax paid on work and tax paid on income from assets. ## Background to the measure These measures were announced at Budget 2025. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date The legislation relating to the property rates, savings rates, and changes to ordering of the allocation of the Personal Allowance will take effect from 6 April 2027 for the 2027 to 2028 tax year and subsequent tax years. The legislation relating to the dividend rates will apply to distributions and to loans or benefits conferred on participators from close companies, made on or after 6 April 2026, for the 2026 to 2027 tax year and subsequent tax years. ## Current law ## Property rates measure: Property income is defined in Part 3 of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005. The tax rates which currently apply to property income are set out in Chapter 2 of Part 2 of the Income Tax Act (ITA) 2007. Section 80C of the Scotland Act 1998 provides for the Scottish Parliament to set Scottish Income Tax rates for Scottish taxpayers. Section 116D of the Government of Wales Act 2006 provides for the Senedd to set Welsh Rates of Income Tax for Welsh taxpayers. ## Savings rates measure: The tax rates which apply to savings income are set out in Chapter 2 of Part 2 of ITA 2007. Section 7A of ITA2007 sets out that the savings basic, higher and additional rates are set by Parliament for each tax year. Since April 2017 the rates have been 20% for basic rate taxpayers, 40% for higher rate taxpayers, and 45% for additional rate taxpayers. ## Dividend rates measure: The tax rates which apply to dividend income are set out in sections 8 and 9 of ITA 2007. Section 13 determines what dividend income is charged at each rate. Since April 2022, the rates have been 8.75% for basic rate taxpayers, 33.75% for higher rate taxpayers, and 39.35% for additional rate taxpayers. The rate of tax charged on loans to, or benefits conferred on, participators under sections 455 and 464A of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 is aligned to the dividend upper rate, so is currently 33.75%. ## Use of Allowances and Reliefs: The calculation of Income Tax liability is set out in Chapter 3 of ITA 2007 with main calculation steps set out in Section 23. Section 24 establishes the reliefs and allowances deductible in Steps 2 and 3 of the calculation and section 25 the order in which they are applied. ## Proposed revisions ## Property rates measure: Legislation will be introduced in Finance Bill 2025-26 that will create separate rates of tax on property income in the Income Tax calculation so that new rates can apply from the 2027 to 2028 tax year. The rates for the 2027 to 2028 tax year will be: - the property basic rate at 22% - the property higher rate at 42% - the property additional rate at 47% The legislation will also amend"}, {"file": "Income Tax \u2014 Changes to Tax rates for Property, Savings and Dividend Income - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "the Scotland Act 1998 and Government of Wales Act 2006 for the Scottish Parliament and the Senedd to be provided with the ability to set devolved property Income Tax rates. These powers will be subject to commencement following engagement with the Scottish Government and the Welsh Government. Secondary legislation will be amended to update the rate of withholding tax for the non-resident landlord scheme and property income distributions by real estate investment trusts and property authorised investment funds, to reflect the new basic rate for property income. Other consequential amendments may be made. ## Savings rates measure: Legislation will be introduced in Finance Bill 2025-26 to set out that the savings basic, higher and additional rates will increase for the 2027 to 2028 tax year to: - 22% savings basic rate - 42% savings higher rate - 47% savings additional rate ## Dividend rates measure: Legislation will be introduced in Finance Bill 2025-26 to change section 8 of ITA 2007 to increase the tax rates which apply to dividend income for the 2026 to 2027 tax year. The new ordinary rate will be 10.75%, and the new upper rate will be 35.75%. The additional rate will remain at 39.35%. This measure will also have the effect of raising the rate of tax charged on loans to, and benefits conferred on, participators. ## Use of Allowances and Reliefs: Legislative amendments will be made to the Income Tax calculation so that general reliefs and allowances will only be applied to property, savings and dividend income after they have been applied to other sources of income. Reliefs and allowances for specific types of income will still apply to those types of income first where relevant. ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3 million) 2025 to 2026 2026 to 2027 2027 to 2028 2028 to 2029 2029 to 2030 2030 to 2031 - +285 +1045 +2275 +2230 +2340 These figures include the fiscal impact of the following measures, which have been costed separately: - Property Income: Increase tax rates on property income by 2ppts at the basic, higher and additional rate from 6 April 2027 - Dividend Income: Increase tax rates on dividend income by 2ppts at the ordinary and upper rate from 6 April 2026 - Savings Income: Increase tax rates on savings income by 2ppts at the basic, higher and additional rate from 6 April 2027 The figures are set out in Table 4.1 of Budget 2025 and have been certified by the Office for Budget Responsibility. More details can be found in the policy costings document published alongside Budget 2025. ## Macroeconomic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. ## Impact on individuals, households and families ## Property rates It is estimated that by 2029 to 2030, 2.4 million landlords (6% of taxpayers in 2029 to 2030) will face an increase in tax as a result of this measure. Administratively this measure will affect individuals (including partners in partnerships) with profits from property rental income."}, {"file": "Income Tax \u2014 Changes to Tax rates for Property, Savings and Dividend Income - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "It is anticipated that both the one-off and ongoing administrative burdens for these individuals will be negligible. The only one-off costs will be familiarisation with the change. No ongoing costs are expected, as there will be no additional information requirement. ## Savings rates It is estimated that by 2029 to 2030, those with savings income above the relevant tax-free allowances, 3.8 million individuals (9% of taxpayers in 2029 to 2030), will face an increase in tax as a result of this measure. They will not need to do anything differently but will need to be aware of the change. However, most taxpayers are not liable to tax on their savings income and the majority of those who do have the tax deducted automatically via tax recoding. ## Dividend rates - It is estimated that by 2029 to 2030, 3.9 million individuals (9% of taxpayers in 2029 to 2030) will face an increase in tax as a result of this measure. - In 2029 to 2030, an estimated 1.6 million individuals will not see a change to the tax on their dividend income. These figures are not additive as the populations overlap. These measures are not expected to impact on family formation, stability or breakdown. These measures are expected overall to have no impact on individuals' experience of dealing with HMRC since the changes will not result in any new tax obligations. ## Equalities impacts An individual may be affected by this measure regardless of their protected characteristics. This measure will impact individuals who pay Income Tax on income from property, savings, or dividends. If a protected group is overrepresented in this population, then it will be disproportionately impacted. The overall impacted population is estimated to be older than the general UK adult population, with 54% aged 55 and above compared to 39% of UK adults. Individuals over State Pension Age are more likely to have taxable savings income and therefore are overrepresented in the population affected by the savings rate increase. However, their representation in the population affected by all three rate increases is broadly in line with that of the UK adult population, therefore pensioners are not expected to be disproportionately impacted overall. Finally, people from an Asian, Asian British or Indian ethnic background are estimated to be overrepresented in the population affected by the property rate increase (4.8%) compared to the UK adult population (2.8%). People from the Hindu faith are also estimated to be overrepresented (2.9%) compared to the UK adult population (1.5%). This reflects that people from this group are more likely to have taxable income from property. HMRC does not currently hold data on the other protected characteristics of individuals impacted by this measure and so cannot make an assessment of the impacts on those with shared protected characteristics. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations These measures are not expected to disproportionately impact civil society organisations. ## Savings rates for 2027 to 2028 There is a negligible impact on businesses. ## Property"}, {"file": "Income Tax \u2014 Changes to Tax rates for Property, Savings and Dividend Income - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "rates for 2027 to 2028 There is a negligible impact on businesses. ## Dividend rates for 2026 to 2027 This measure is expected to have a negligible impact on companies that use dividends to remunerate shareholders, and on closely controlled companies who choose to make loans to participators. One-off costs will include businesses familiarising themselves with the change. Further one-off costs could include businesses needing to update their systems to reflect the increase. There are not expected to be any additional on-going costs. ## Operational impact (\u00a3 million) (HMRC or other) HMRC will need to implement changes to IT systems across all three measures to help support safe implementation of this measure. These changes are expected to cost in the region of \u00a33.2 million. There are no changes to reporting requirements due to these measures. Customers will report and pay tax liability for all three changes through existing Income Tax Self-Assessment (ITSA) or PAYE (Pay As You Earn) channels. Where collection is through PAYE this is done through tax codes issued to employers. Where appropriate guidance and calculators will be updated ready for implementation of the respective rates to help taxpayers understand the changes and calculate their future Income Tax liability. ## Other impacts Other impacts have been considered and none have been identified. ## Monitoring and evaluation The measure will be monitored through information collected from tax receipts. ## Further advice If you have any questions about these changes, see Technical Note (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/changes-to-tax-rates-for-property-savingsand-dividend-income).

From: HM Treasury Published The Rt Hon Rachel Reeves MP and 26 November 2025 Delivered on: 26 November 2025 (Transcript of the speech, exactly as it was delivered) Madame Deputy Speaker. It is my understanding that the O ffi ce for Budget Responsibility's Economic and Fiscal Outlook was released on their website before this statement. This is deeply disappointing and a serious error on their part. The O ffi ce for Budget Responsibility has already made a statement taking full responsibility for their breach. Madame Deputy Speaker. We are rebuilding our economy. Over the last sixteen months, we have overhauled our planning system - to get Britain building; Forged new trade deals, with the United States, India and the European Union; Reformed our visa system to bring the brightest and the best to Britain; We changed our fiscal rules [redacted political content] and raised public investment to its highest level in four decades; And in last year's Budget, I raised taxes on business and the wealthiest\u2026 [redacted political content] \u2026and we used that money - to fund the biggest ever settlement for our National Health Service. They were the fair and necessary choices. And we faced opposition to them. From opponents to planning reform, who will always demand that the future is built somewhere else, not in their back yard; Opponents to trade, who want to take us down the path of isolation and division; Opponents to investment - who believe that the only good thing a government can do is get out of the way; Opponents who insist that the only way to balance the books is to cut public spending; And opponents who say that we don't need to balance the books at all. But we made these choices for a reason. [redacted political content] Investment, not cuts, to our public services; Stability for our public finances - the single most important factor in getting the cost of living down; And economic growth - the best means to improve wages, create jobs, and support public services. That is what our plan - that is what this government, and our Prime Minister is all about. Today's Budget builds on the choices that we have made since last July. To cut NHS waiting lists. To cut the cost of living. And to cut debt and borrowing. No doubt, we will face opposition again. But I have yet to see a credible, or a fairer alternative plan for working people. These are my choices - the right choices for a fairer, a stronger, and more secure Britain. Madame Deputy Speaker, I said there would be no return to austerity, and I meant it: This Budget will maintain investment in our economy and in our National Health Service. I said I would cut the cost of living, and I meant it: This Budget will bring down inflation and provide immediate relief for families. I said I would cut debt and"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 speech - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "borrowing, and I meant it: Because of this Budget, borrowing will fall as a share of GDP in every year of this forecast\u2026 \u2026our Net Financial Debt will be lower at the end of the forecast than it is today\u2026 \u2026and I will more than double the headroom against our stability rule to \u00a321.7 billion - meeting our stability rule and meeting it a year early. These are my choices. Not austerity. Not borrowing. Not turning a blind eye to unfairness. My choice is a Budget for fair taxes, strong public services, and a stable economy. [redacted political content] Growth is the engine that carries every one of our ambitions forward. Through Stability, Investment and Reform - The platform from which British ambition can finally get moving again. Because growth doesn't just appear out of thin air. It is built - patiently, and stubbornly, by the people who take risks, By founders who bet their savings on an idea, By firms breaking into new markets, developing new technologies, creating new jobs and new opportunities, By the men and the women who work hard every day in all parts of our country. Our job is not to watch from the sidelines, but to partner with them- backing them every step of the way. To match private enterprise with public ambition. I would like to thank my team of o ffi cials at the Treasury for their hard work in preparing this Budget. In the Spring, the OBR forecast that our economy would grow by 1% this year. I said then that Britain would defy the forecasts\u2026 And defy them we have. The OBR have upgraded Britain's growth for this year from 1% to 1.5%. Reaching the same conclusion as the IMF, the OECD and the Bank of England who have all already upgraded their forecasts\u2026 Today, the OBR have published their result of their review of the supply side of our economy They are clear that this is not about [redacted political content] - the legacy of Brexit and the pandemic\u2026 [redacted political content] As a result of their review, the OBR are reducing their expectations for productivity growth by 0.3ppts to 1% by the end of the forecast. They say today, and I quote 'Real GDP is forecast to grow by 1.5% on average over the forecast \u2026due to lower underlying productivity growth.' There is an impact on our public finances too - the OBR say that their productivity forecast will mean \u00a316bn less in tax receipts by 2030. [redacted political content] We beat the forecasts this year and we will beat them again: By boosting trade, not blocking it. By increasing investment, not cutting it. By championing innovation, not stifling it. By backing working people, not making them poorer. Brick by brick we've been building our economy. Building roads, building homes, Getting spades in the ground and cranes in the sky. Growth begins with the spark of an entrepreneur: Half of new jobs in Britain are created by scale-up"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 speech - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "businesses. And we want those jobs created here not somewhere else. Our job is to make Britain the best place in the world to start up, to scale up, and to stay. So we're widening eligibility for our enterprise incentives-so scaleups can attract the talent and the capital that they need: Expanding the Enterprise Management Incentive so more companies can o ff er tax-relieved share options, Re-engineering our Enterprise Investment and Venture Capital Trust Schemes so they don't just back early-stage ideas-but stay with companies as they grow. Introducing UK listings relief: A three-year exemption from Stamp Duty Reserve Tax for companies who choose to list here in Britain. And to continue this work I am launching a Call for Evidence on how our tax system can better back entrepreneurs\u2026 \u2026and a targeted review with founders and investors at the heart to make the UK an even more attractive place to grow your business. We are sending a simple message to the world: If you build here, Britain will back you. And our retail investment system should do the same. The UK has some of the lowest levels of retail investment in the G7. And that is not only bad for business, who need that investment to grow\u2026 \u2026it's bad for savers too. Someone who's invested \u00a31,000 a year in an average stocks and shares ISA every year since 1999 would be \u00a350,000 better o ff today than if they'd put the same money into a cash ISA. And so from April 2027, I will reform our ISA system\u2026 \u2026keeping the full \u00a320,000 allowance while designating \u00a38,000 of it exclusively for investment\u2026 \u2026with over 65s retaining the full cash allowance. And thanks to our changes to financial advice and guidance, banks will be able to guide savers to better choices for their hard-earned money. Over 50% of the ISA market - including Hargreaves Lansdown, HSBC, Lloyds, Vanguard and Barclays - have signed up to launch new online hubs to help people invest here in Britain. At this Budget, consistent with the commitments in our corporate tax roadmap, I will retain our competitive corporation tax rate, the lowest in the G7\u2026 \u2026and retain our generous full expensing o ff er for business investment. I will also introduce a new 40% first-year allowance so that businesses can write o ff more of the cost of their investment upfront\u2026 \u2026while reducing main rate writing down allowances in line with fiscal constraints. Private investment is the lifeblood of economic growth\u2026 \u2026but growth needs public investment too. When faced with challenges, previous Chancellors have chosen to decrease, delay or cancel capital spending\u2026 \u2026but low investment is the cause of our productivity problems, not the solution. So my choice is not cuts, Not stagnation. But to maintain the additional \u00a3120 billion of investment I provided at the spending review\u2026 \u2026 in transport to link our towns and our cities; Energy infrastructure to power our businesses; And housing so people can live near good jobs paying decent"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 speech - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "wages and growing businesses.

It is this Labour government that has invested in nuclear power - in Sizewell C, and in Culham\u2026 We are taking forward our commitment to slash electricity prices for thousands of manufacturing businesses, as MakeUK and many others have called for\u2026 \u2026and today I'm pleased to welcome John Fingleton's report: An ambitious plan to cut the red tape that has tied our nuclear industry in knots for decades\u2026 \u2026and within three months we will set out our plan for delivering his recommendations. We are proud of our industrial heritage\u2026 \u2026and we are determined to build the industry of the future\u2026 \u2026so that we buy, make and sell more here in Britain. That's why as we increase defence spending, we are investing in Portsmouth, in Barrow and in Plymouth. And I am pleased to be supporting Team Derby, an initiative to drive growth in one of our defence industry hubs. It's why we stepped in to save British Steel in Scunthorpe and invested in She ffi eld Forgemasters. And it's why we've changed government procurement - so we can buy British when it is crucial to our national security For Steel, For Shipbuilding\u2026 \u2026and today for AI, driving innovation and building that great industry here in Britain. But it's not just what we invest in that matters, it's how we invest\u2026 \u2026putting money and power back in the hands of local and regional leaders. Today we are devolving \u00a313bn of flexible funding for seven Mayors to invest in skills, business support and infrastructure. I am extending the business rates retention pilots in the West of England, Liverpool City Region and Cornwall until 2029\u2026 \u2026and providing \u00a330m for the Kernow Industrial Growth Fund for sectors like critical minerals and marine innovation. I am establishing the Leeds City Fund: A long-term agreement to retain business rates to fund local regeneration projects like the development of Leeds South Bank\u2026 \u2026.and I am allocating \u00a320m for the new Peterborough sports quarter and \u00a316m for a science centre in Darlington from the Growth Mission Fund.

That is good for business\u2026 \u2026and it is good for working people - so they have more money in their pockets. Economic stability, safeguarded by iron-clad fiscal rules, is our best defence against rising prices and the best way to improve living standards. [redacted political content] Our Net Financial Debt this year will be \u00a32.6trillion: 83% of GDP. Meaning that today, 1 in every \u00a310 that government spends is on debt interest\u2026 \u2026not on paying down that debt, but just on paying the interest. My fiscal rules will get borrowing down while supporting investment : The stability rule - that day-to-day expenditure must be met through tax receipts\u2026 \u2026and the investment rule - which allows me to increase investment while getting debt on a downward path. Those fiscal rules are non-negotiable. I met them at the Budget last year, I met them in the Spring and I have met them today. While the current budget balance is in deficit by \u00a328.8bn in 26/27 and \u00a34.6bn in 27/28\u2026 \u2026it moves into a surplus of \u00a33.9bn in 28/29, \u00a321.7bn in 29/30 and \u00a324.6bn in 30/31\u2026 \u2026more than doubling our headroom against the stability rule and meeting that rule a year early too.

Madame Deputy Speaker, I said we would cut the debt and we are - with debt down by the end of the forecast. And going forwards, to support our commitment to a single fiscal event and further strengthen our economic stability\u2026 \u2026I will follow the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund by assessing the fiscal rules just once a year at the Budget. Despite the challenges we face on productivity, the path of our deficit reduction remains broadly the same as in Spring\u2026 \u2026 public sector net borrowing is due to be"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 speech - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "\u00a3112.1bn or 3.5% of GDP in 26/27, 3.0% in 27/28, 2.6% in 28/29, 1.9% in 29/30 and 1.9% in 30/31 - ending at \u00a367.2bn Translating into an increase in the net cash requirement next year of \u00a34.2bn, taking the total to \u00a3133.3bn.

The reforms I made last year will raise an additional \u00a38bn a year by 2030 from wealth: I increased taxes last year on private equity, private schools and private jets, I abolished the non-dom tax regime - and this year I will make two changes to cap trust charges and prevent avoidance.

Madame Deputy Speaker, reliefs in our tax system cost the taxpayer billions of pounds a year\u2026 \u2026but many of them no longer serve their original purpose. The government rightly provides generous tax relief for people paying into a pension\u2026 \u2026relieving Income Tax on all contributions and on the investment itself\u2026 \u2026as well as National Insurance relief on employer contributions\u2026 \u2026.at a cost of over \u00a370bn a year to the exchequer. This Budget makes no changes to those reliefs or to the tax-free lump sum. But salary sacrifice for pensions, which was intended to be a small part of our pensions system, is forecast to almost treble in cost to other taxpayers from \u00a32.8bn in 2017 to \u00a38bn by 2030\u2026 \u2026with the greatest benefit going to higher earners\u2026 \u2026or to those in the financial services sector putting their bonuses into pensions tax-free\u2026 \u2026while those on the minimum wage or those whose employers don't o ff er salary sacrifice don't benefit at all. This is not sustainable for our public finances\u2026 \u2026putting pressure on the tax everyone else pays\u2026 \u2026and so I am introducing a \u00a32,000 cap on salary sacrifice into a pension\u2026 \u2026with contributions above that taxed in the same way as other employee pension contributions. That is a pragmatic step so that people, especially on low and middle incomes, can continue to use salary sacrifice for their pension without paying any more in tax than they do now.

[redacted political content] I came into politics, because I believe every child has equal worth and deserves an equal chance to achieve their promise. The biggest barrier to equal opportunity is child poverty. Because for every child that grows up in poverty, our society pays a triple cost. The first and the heaviest is to the child: Going to school hungry\u2026 Waking up in a cold home, or in another B&amp;B\u2026 While other children enjoy the advantages of parents with time to help with homework, the quiet space at home to work in - too many go without. And there is also the cost of supporting a family in poverty which ends up in the lap of overstretched councils\u2026 \u2026 who can do no more than shunt them into temporary accommodation, at huge cost to local taxpayers. Then there is the future cost: To our economy and to our society, of wasted talent and a welfare system that bears the cost of failure for decades to come: Young people with so much to contribute, but whose potential is su ocated ff early by limited life chances and missed opportunities\u2026 \u2026 struggling to make their way in a society that did not look out for them.

Since last July, we've rolled out free breakfast clubs in schools; We're expanding free school meals to half a million more kids, lifting 100,000 children out of poverty as we do it; We've passed the Renters' Rights Act And we've extended the childcare o ff er.

This publication is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/changes-to-charity-taxrules/legislation-to-introduce-changes-to-charity-tax-rules ## Who is likely to be affected All UK charities, Community Amateur Sports Clubs (CASCs) and their donors will be subject to the changes being introduced. However, only a small number are likely to be affected by the changes. ## General description of the measure At Autumn Budget 2024, following a consultation in 2023, the government announced four changes to charity compliance rules. ## Tainted donations to charities The Tainted Charity Donations rules ensure that the usual tax reliefs are not available where donors enter into arrangements to obtain a financial advantage from a charity or CASC for themselves, or someone else involved in the arrangement, in return for their donation. The government will change the rules governing what is regarded as a tainted donation. HMRC will no longer look solely at the motivation of the donor to determine whether a donation is tainted. Instead HMRC will also look to the outcome of the transaction. In addition, the government will seek to lower the bar for establishing whether a transaction is tainted by replacing the test of 'financial advantage' with 'financial assistance'. ## Approved charitable investments There are twelve investment types that the government recognises for charitable tax relief purposes. Currently only one of them is subject to the requirement that the investment must be made for the benefit of the charity and not for the avoidance of tax (whether by the charity or any other person). The government will legislate to extend this requirement to all twelve categories. This will simplify the rules which will be the same for all investment categories. ## Attributable income Legacies that a charity or CASC receives may have been subject to considerable Inheritance Tax relief. The government will legislate to bring legacies into the attributable income definition. This means the legacy must be spent on the charity's charitable purpose. Otherwise it will be subject to a tax charge. This will also equalise the treatment of income from an estate in the hands of the charity, the residual value of an estate already being treated as attributable income. ## Sanctions for failure to meet tax obligations"}, {"file": "Legislation to introduce changes to charity tax rules - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "The majority of charities meet their tax obligations but a small minority persistently fail to comply and yet still claim tax reliefs such as Gift Aid. HMRC are working on changes to guidance that improve the powers of HMRC to compel compliance through sanctioning trustees and charity managers. For tainted donations, approved investments and attributable income HMRC published draft legislation at Legislation Day 2025. Following feedback some adjustments have been made and the government will introduce legislation in Finance Bill 2025-26. The changes will take effect from April 2026. HMRC will publish draft guidance for the measure to sanction charities for failure to meet their tax obligations later. ## Policy objective This measure will support the government's aims of closing the tax gap through strengthening compliance powers to challenge abusive arrangements. At the same time some of the measures will simplify the current tax rules by equalising treatment across all investment types and across different sources of income and expenditure for the charity. ## Background to the measure The measure follows a consultation that was announced in March 2023 and closed in July 2023. The summary of responses for this consultation was published at Autumn Budget 2024. Draft legislation was published at Legislation Day 2025 and the legislation for the changes will be introduced in Finance Bill 2025-26. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date The measure will have effect for transactions that occur: - on or after 6 April 2026, for entities that report through Income Tax Self Assessment and - on or after 1 April 2026, for entities that report through Corporation Tax Self Assessment ## Current law Current law is: - for tainted donations, in sections 809ZJ to 809ZO of Income Tax Act 2007, and sections 939C to 939I of Corporation Tax Act 2010 - for approved charitable investments, in section 511 Corporation Tax Act 2010 and section 558 Income Tax Act 2007 and - for attributable income, in Part 10 of Income Tax Act 2007 and Chapters 2 and 3 of Part 11 Corporation Tax Act 2010 ## Proposed revisions The government is introducing legislation in Finance Bill 2025-26 to amend the rules governing tainted donations, approved charitable investments and attributable income for charities and CASCs: - for tainted donations Condition B will be changed: 'main purpose' will be replaced by 'outcome', and 'financial advantage' will be replaced by 'financial assistance' - for approved investments the condition that the purpose of the investment must be to benefit the charity and not to avoid tax will be extended to all investment types - for attributable income legacies received by the charity will become chargeable to tax if they are not spent charitably ## Summary of impacts Exchequer impact (\u00a3 million) | 2025 to 2026 | 2026 to 2027 | 2027 to 2028 | 2028 to 2029 | 2029 to 2030 | 2030 to 2031 | |----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------| | nil | +20 | +35 | +35 | +40 | +40 | These figures are set out in table 4.2 of"}, {"file": "Legislation to introduce changes to charity tax rules - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "Autumn Budget 2024 and have been certified by the Office for Budget Responsibility.

This measure is not expected to impact on family formation, stability or breakdown. There may be some impact on the customer experience of individuals as the measure will require donors and charities to familiarise themselves with the new rules. The changes do have the effect of regularising the treatment for different types of activity which will help simplify the rules. ## Equalities impacts An individual may be affected by this measure regardless of their protected characteristics. HMRC does not currently hold data on the protected characteristics of individuals impacted by this measure and so cannot make an assessment of the impacts on those with shared protected characteristics. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations This measure will have a negligible impact on businesses and civil society organisations such as charities. One-off costs will include familiarisation with these new rules and setting up processes to ensure that they are met. Ongoing costs will include time taken for employees to ensure that charities continue to meet HMRC's requirements for tainted donations, charitable investments, and charitable expenditure. This includes time to prepare and maintain records in line with HMRC requirements and any costs associated with dealing with HMRC enquiries. The changes do have the effect of regularising the treatment for different types of activity which will help simplify the rules. HMRC will help the sector understand and prepare for the change by providing clear communications and guidance. ## Operational impact (\u00a3 million) (HMRC or other) Changes to HMRC IT systems will incur estimated costs of \u00a31 million. HMRC will not need to deploy additional operational resource. ## Other impacts Other impacts have been considered and none have been identified. ## Monitoring and evaluation Once the measures have been implemented, HMRC will assess the impact by monitoring tax reliefs claimed by UK charities and CASCs with no new evaluation planned. None of HMRC's evaluation principles apply to this measure. ## Further advice If you have any questions about this change, contact Sean Perkins, Charities Policy at email charitypolicy.taxteam@hmrc.gov.uk.

You must check that you can use the scheme and follow the scheme rules, so that your investors can claim and keep Enterprise Investment Scheme tax reliefs relating to their shares. Tax reliefs will be withheld or withdrawn from your investors if you do not follow the rules for at least 3 years after the investment is made. ## Different rules for knowledge-intensive companies There are different rules if you are a knowledge-intensive company and you carry out a significant amount of research, development or innovation, and you: - want to raise more than \u00a312 million in the company's lifetime - did not receive investment under a venture capital scheme within 7 years of your first commercial sale There are also increased limits for your investors. You can find out more in the following guidance: 'Use a venture capital scheme to raise money for your knowledge intensive company' (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/use-the-enterpriseinvestment-scheme-eis-to-raise-money-for-research-development-or-innovation). ## Before you apply You'll need to check: - that your company can use the scheme - you will meet the conditions - what you can do with money raised - limits on money raised and the age of your company - if your company owns or controls any other companies - you meet the risk to capital condition ## Check that your company can use the scheme Your company can use the scheme if it: - has a permanent establishment (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/venture-capital-schemespermanent-establishment) in the UK - is not trading on a recognised stock exchange (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/recognised-stock-exchanges) at the time of the share issue and does not plan to do so - does not control another company other than qualifying subsidiaries - is not controlled by another company, or does not have more than 50% of its shares owned by another company - does not expect to close after completing a project or series of projects Your company and any qualifying subsidiaries must:"}, {"file": "Apply to use the Enterprise Investment Scheme to raise money for your company - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "- not have gross assets worth more than \u00a315 million before any shares are issued, and not more than \u00a316 million immediately afterwards - have less than 250 full-time equivalent employees at the time the shares are issued Your company must carry out a qualifying trade (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/venturecapital-schemes-raise-money-by-offering-tax-reliefs-to-investors). If you're part of a group, the majority of the group's activities must be qualifying trades. ## Check you will meet the conditions You must meet the conditions to use the Enterprise Investment Scheme before your investors will be able to claim tax relief. You can ask HMRC if your share issue is likely to qualify before you go ahead, this is called advance assurance (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/venture-capital-schemes-applyfor-advance-assurance). ## Check what you can do with money raised Money raised by a new share issue must be used for a qualifying business activity which is either: - a qualifying trade (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/venture-capital-schemes-raise-money-byoffering-tax-reliefs-to-investors) - preparing to carry out a qualifying trade -this must start within 2 years of the investment - research and development that's expected to lead to a qualifying trade - such as a project to make an advance in science or technology The money raised by the new share issue must: - be spent within 2 years of the investment, or if later, the date you started trading - not be used to buy all or part of another business - pose a risk of loss to capital for the investor - be used to grow or develop your business ## Limits on money raised Your company cannot raise more than \u00a35 million in total in any 12 month period from: - Enterprise Investment Scheme - Venture Capital Trusts (VCT) - the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/seedenterprise-investment-scheme-how-companies-qualify) (SEIS) - social investment tax relief (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/venture-capital-schemesapply-to-use-social-investment-tax-relief) (SITR) - state aid approved under the risk finance guidelines - check with the person who gave you the aid for advice Your company cannot raise more than \u00a312 million from these sources in your company's lifetime. This includes any money received by any subsidiaries, former subsidiaries or businesses you've acquired. ## Limits on the age of your company You can receive investment under the Enterprise Investment Scheme if it's within 7 years of your company's first commercial sale. If you have any subsidiaries (including former subsidiaries) or businesses you've acquired, the date of your first commercial sale is the earliest of the group. If you received investment in this period under the schemes in 'Limits on money raised', you can use the Enterprise Investment Scheme to raise money for the same activity - if you show you were planning to do so in your original business plan. If you did not receive investment within the first 7 years, or now want to raise money for a different activity from a previous investment, you'll have to show that the money: - is required to enter a completely new product market or a new geographic market - you're seeking is at least 50% of your company's average annual turnover for the last"}, {"file": "Apply to use the Enterprise Investment Scheme to raise money for your company - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "5 years ## Qualifying subsidiary companies If your company owns or controls any other companies they need to be 'qualifying subsidiaries'. This means: - your company must own more than 50% of the subsidiary's shares - no one other than your company or one of its other qualifying subsidiaries can control this subsidiary - there cannot be any arrangements which would put someone else in control of this subsidiary The subsidiary must be at least 90% owned by your company where either the: - business activity you're going to spend the investment on is to be carried out by the qualifying subsidiary - subsidiary's business is mainly property or land management The subsidiary can be set up to complete a project or series of projects before closing, if it supports the growth and development of your company. ## Meeting the risk to capital condition The investment in your company must meet the risk to capital condition, which means: - your company must aim to grow and develop its trade long term - the investment should be a risk to the investors' capital Growth and development means you'll use the investment to grow things like your revenue, customer base and number of employees. The growth and development of your company should be permanent and not rely on the investor's continued support. The investment should carry a risk that the investor will lose more capital than they are likely to gain as a net return. We will not consider the maximum return an investor could get if your company is successful, because this cannot be guaranteed. The net return includes: - income from dividends, interest payments and other fees - capital growth - upfront tax relief When deciding if you meet the risk to capital condition, we'll look at: - sources of income - assets - structure - use of subcontractors - marketing of the investment opportunity - relationship with other companies You will not meet the risk to capital condition if there are risk reducing arrangements in place that result in an investor: - getting priority over other investors - being able to withdraw their money as soon as possible - protecting their money so that other investors money is used first ## Issuing shares The shares you issue must be paid up in full, in cash, when they're issued. Your company should have a way to accept payment before shares are issued. Your shares for Enterprise Investment Scheme investments must be full risk ordinary shares which: - are not redeemable - carry no special rights to your assets The shares you issue can have limited preferential rights to dividends. However, the rights to receive dividends cannot be allowed to accumulate or allow the dividend to ## be varied.

If you've not got advance assurance, you must provide the following information for your company and any subsidiaries: - the business plan and financial forecasts - a copy of the latest accounts - an explanation of how you meet the risk to capital condition - details of all trading and activities to be carried out, and how much you expect to spend on each activity - an up to date copy of the memorandum and articles of association - the information memorandum, prospectus or other documents used to explain the fundraising proposal to your investors - details of any other agreements between your company and the shareholder - a list of the amounts, dates and venture capital schemes under which you've previously received investment - any other documents to show you meet the qualifying conditions You'll also need to show evidence that you're a knowledge intensive company (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/use-the-enterprise-investment-scheme-eis-to-raise-money-forresearch-development-or-innovation) if you're applying as one.

You must submit it within 2 years of this date, or within 2 years of the end of the tax year in which the shares were issued (whichever is later). You must complete a new statement for each share issue. For the shares to be treated as issued under the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS) you must use the Compliance Statement form SEIS1 (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/venture-capital-schemes-apply-to-use-the-seed-enterpriseinvestment-scheme). Once shares are issued under the Enterprise Investment Scheme then the company cannot issue shares under the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme. ## Apply with a compliance statement You can submit a compliance statement if you are: - the company secretary - a director - an agent You can authorise an agent to apply on your behalf. They'll need to provide a signed letter dated within the last 3 months confirming that they are entitled to act on your behalf.

The money claimed to have been contributed to the trust is subsequently transferred, typically via another company, to the company's director or back to the self-employed person. The director claims the funds received this way are held as 'loans' or held in a fiduciary capacity. HMRC has determined that these amounts are subject to tax, and recent tribunal decisions for the corporate users support this. We have published a document that shows BWL and MSL (the 'Promoters') encouraging URT users to sign a declaration that claims the URT to which contributions were made is void, and HMRC must close its enquiries as they are invalid, and instead make a 'replacement' contribution to a newly founded 'Nova' Trust. HMRC considers this to be an acknowledgement by the Promoters that the URT arrangements do not work. The enquiries remain valid and HMRC considers that the Nova Trust arrangements are a continuation of the arrangements used by the URT, and therefore subject to tax and NICs. HMRC would encourage all users of the URT not to enter into Nova without obtaining independent advice.

Explanation of terms used ## Accelerated Payment Notice (APN) An APN is a requirement to pay an amount on account of tax or National Insurance contributions. HMRC issues APNs to taxpayers involved in avoidance schemes where an SRN has been allocated under the DOTAS rules, or ones in respect of which HMRC has given a General Anti-Abuse Rule counteraction notice. They can also be issued to taxpayers who have received a follower notice in relation to a scheme. ## Authorised O ffi cer An authorised o ffi cer is a person that has been authorised by the Commissioners for HMRC for the purpose of the 2022 legislation (section 86 Finance Act 2022). Only authorised o ffi cers can authorise the publication of information under the section. For the purposes of this legislation, authorised o ffi cers will be senior civil servants and independent of any compliance activity relating to the tax avoidance scheme in question. ## Conduct notice A conduct notice forms part of the POTAS regime. It is issued by HMRC and imposes conditions on a promoter that must be complied with. ## Connected persons For the purposes of the 2022 legislation, a person is a connected person in relation to a scheme, or to a promoter of a scheme, if the person is within one of 5 specified categories. Read more information about connected persons. ## Enabler Any person who is responsible, to any extent, for the design, management, marketing or otherwise facilitating another person to enter into abusive tax arrangements. ## Entity A business entity is an organisation created to conduct business, engage in a trade or partake in similar activities. For example, a 'partnership', 'company' or 'limited liability partnership'. ## Follower Notice A follower notice can be given to a person who has used an avoidance scheme that has been shown in another person's litigation to be ine ff ective. The follower notice tells the person they may be liable to a penalty of up to 30% of the tax and/or NICs in dispute if they do not amend their return or settle their dispute. ## Promoter A person is a promoter if they are carrying on a business that includes, or has included, the design, marketing, implementation, organisation or management of tax avoidance schemes. A 'person' could be an individual, company or partnership. ## Scheme reference number (SRN) A SRN is a number allocated to a tax avoidance scheme by HMRC at the time the scheme is disclosed to them, or, where a scheme has not been disclosed and HMRC reasonably suspect that the scheme should have been disclosed. It allows HMRC to identify and track users of disclosed tax avoidance schemes. The"}, {"file": "Current list of named tax avoidance schemes, promoters, enablers and suppliers - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "allocation of a SRN does not mean that HMRC has in any way approved or cleared a scheme for use. ## Stop Notice Stop notices may be issued to a person who HMRC suspects is promoting an avoidance scheme, which they consider does not work. If a promoter does not comply with a stop notice they would meet a POTAS threshold condition. This may lead to HMRC giving them a conduct notice. ## Monitoring notice A monitoring notice forms part of the POTAS regime. It is issued by HMRC where a promoter breaches a requirement in a conduct notice. A promoter that is subject to a monitoring notice is referred to as a monitored promoter and is subject to various disclosure requirements and other obligations and a strict penalty regime where those requirements or obligations are not met. ## Supplier Supplier refers to persons involved in the supply of tax avoidance schemes. 'Supplier' includes promoters and also other suppliers who do not meet the definition of promoter. There are many di ff erent ways a person may be involved in the supply of the scheme.

Since 2006 the number of UK REITs has grown to 127, the real estate sector has evolved and the number of large institutional investors in REITs has increased. Certain rules no longer serve a purpose, create unnecessary cost and administrative burden for some REITs, or do not now work as originally intended. The objective of this measure is to modernise the regime, and alleviate certain constraints and administrative burdens to enhance the attractiveness of the UK REIT regime for real estate investment in line with the overall policy intent. ## Background to the measure A 'Review of the UK funds regime: a call for input' was published on 26 January 2021 with a summary of responses issued on 10 February 2022. As part of this wider review of the UK funds regime, the government considered proposals for further changes to the REIT regime to reduce unnecessary burdens and make the regime more attractive for investment in the UK. Some of these changes were made in Finance Act 2022 and Finance Act 2023. This measure brings forward a third tranche of changes. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date All changes will have effect on and after the date of Royal Assent to Finance Bill 2023-24 other than: - the amendments which make clear that it is possible to trace through intermediate holding companies where an institutional investor is the ultimate beneficial owner of the shares in the REIT will be treated as always having had effect - the amendments to the definition of property financing costs will be treated as always having had effect ## Current law Current law is included in Part 12 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (CTA 2010). The condition that a REIT company must not be a close company,"}, {"file": "Corporation Tax \u2014 amendments to the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) regime - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "including the exemption from the rule for participators who are institutional investors and the list of those institutional investors, is in section 528. The rule allowing a REIT to hold a single commercial property is in section 529. The exemption from tax on gains on disposals by REITs of rights or interests in a UK property rich company is provided for at section 535A. The profit to financing cost ratio is in section 543 and section 544. The rule that prevents insurance businesses from holding an interest of 75% or more in a REIT group is at section 606. The modifications of the corporate interest restriction (CIR) rules for REITs are in section 452 of the Taxation (International and Other Provisions) Act 2010 (TIOPA 2010). ## Proposed revisions This measure makes the following revisions to CTA 2010: - amend the definition of 'institutional investor' in section 528(4A) to require authorised unit trusts, open-ended investment companies (including, in each case overseas equivalents), and collective investment scheme limited partnerships to meet a genuine diversity of ownership condition or a non-close condition. The amendment will also require persons acting in the course of a long-term insurance business to meet a non-close condition in order to qualify as an institutional investor. - amend the rule in section 528(4)(b) to confirm that it is possible to trace through intermediate holding companies where an institutional investor is the ultimate beneficial owner when applying the exemption from the non-close condition - amend section 529(2B) which defines the 'relevant time' for the purposes of the valuation of a property held by a REIT to ensure the rule for REITs involving a single commercial property works as intended where there is a change in the property held - expand the exemption for gains on disposals of interests in UK property rich companies in section 535A to include gains realised on disposal of interests in a UK property rich Co-ownership Authorised Contractual Schemes (CoACS). - repealing parts of section 606 to enable insurance companies to have an interest of 75% or more in a group UK REIT - amend section 544(3) and insert section 544(3A) to clarify for the purposes of the profit to financing cost ratio that 'property financing costs' means financing costs which are referrable to the UK property rental business and insert section 544(4A) to exclude from the definition of property financing costs certain amounts in respect of which a deduction is denied for corporation tax purposes In addition, the measure will amend section 542 of TIOPA 2010 so that for the purposes of the CIR, the REIT exemption for disposals of rights or interests in UK property rich companies (section 535A CTA 2010) is disapplied in the same way the REIT exemption for direct disposals of assets (section 535 CTA 2010). ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3 million) | 2023 to 2024 | 2024 to 2025 | 2025 to 2026 | 2026 to 2027 | 2027 to 2028 | 2028 to 2029 | |----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|"}, {"file": "Corporation Tax \u2014 amendments to the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) regime - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "| - | empty | empty | empty | empty | empty | The final costing will be subject to scrutiny by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), and will be set out at the next fiscal event. ## Economic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. ## Impact on individuals, households and families There is no impact on individuals as this measure only affects businesses. ## Equalities impacts It is not expected that there will be adverse effects on any group sharing protected characteristics. ## Impact on business including civil society organisations This measure will have a negligible impact on 127 existing REITs, investors in REITs and additional businesses that may elect to become a UK REIT. One-off costs for businesses already in the REIT regime will include familiarisation with the changes. There is not expected to be any continuing costs for those businesses. The measure could also widen the scope of businesses able to enter the UK REIT regime. These businesses' one-off costs could include familiarisation with the changes and registration into the regime. Continuing costs could include having to record more information, doing more calculations and providing HMRC with information to comply with the regime. This measure is expected overall to improves businesses' experience of dealing with HMRC as it will alleviate certain constraints associated with the UK REIT regime and clarify and improve the operation of the legislation. This may make investment in REITs more attractive for some investors. This measure is not expected to impact civil society organisations. ## Operational impact (\u00a3 million) (HMRC or other) There are anticipated to be operational costs estimated to be \u00a32.13 million for this change. These costs include changes to IT systems used for reporting to support compliance monitoring with aspects of the measure, plus a small amount of staffing costs. ## Other impacts Other impacts have been considered and none have been identified. ## Monitoring and evaluation The measure will be kept under review through ongoing communication with affected taxpayer groups. None of the HMRC's Evaluation Principles criteria apply to this measure ## Further advice If you have any questions about this change, please contact the REIT policy team, email: financialservicesbai@hmrc.gov.uk.

This publication is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/annual-tax-onenveloped-dwellings-availability-of-relief/annual-tax-on-enveloped-dwellings-out-of-time-claims-torelief ## Who is likely to be affected Companies, collective investment schemes and partnerships with company members (collectively referred to as non-natural persons (NNPs)) owning UK residential property valued over \u00a3500,000. ## General description of the measure Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings (ATED) is an annual charge on dwellings owned by companies (known as 'enveloping'), its aim being to discourage uncommercial enveloping. Relief can be claimed for dwellings used for commercial purposes, for example in a property business. This measure updates the legislation to ensure that relief is available to NNPs owning residential property for commercial purposes. ## Policy objective In line with the policy intent, this measure ensures that relief from ATED is available to those companies holding property for commercial purposes. Late returns remain subject to robust late filing penalties. ## Background to the measure This measure was announced at Budget 2025. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date The measure will come into force on the date of Royal Assent to Finance Bill 2025-26 and has effect as if it had always been in force. The measure applies UK-wide. ## Current law The current law relating to ATED is contained in Part 3 Finance Act (FA) 2013 at Sections 94 to 174 and Schedules 33 to 35. Section 106 deals with situations where the amount of tax chargeable is either higher or lower than the initial amount of tax chargeable. The initial amount of tax chargeable is the amount due under Section 99. Section 106(1) deals with situations where the adjusted chargeable amount is greater than the initial amount of tax chargeable, meaning more tax is due, and sections 106(3) to (8) deal with situations where the adjusted chargeable amount is less than the initial amount of tax chargeable, meaning less tax is due. In any case where a claim to relief is made under section 106(3) because the adjusted chargeable amount is less than the initial amount chargeable, section 106(5) provides that the relief must be claimed in an ATED return, or by an amendment to an ATED return. Section 106(6) provides that the claim to relief must be delivered by the end of the chargeable period following the"}, {"file": "Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings: out of time claims to relief - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "one to which the claim relates (that is within 12 months of the end of the chargeable period which the claim relates to). ## Proposed revisions Legislation will be introduced in Finance Bill 2025-26 to remove the time limit in section 106(6) of Part 3 FA 2013, the effect being that claims to relief made in an ATED return can be made without time limit. The time limit within which to amend an ATED return (a way in which a claim can be made) set out in paragraph 3 of Schedule 33 FA 2013 will still apply. Penalties will continue to apply to ATED returns not delivered by the filing deadline. ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3 million) | 2025 to 2026 | 2026 to 2027 | 2027 to 2028 | 2028 to 2029 | 2029 to 2030 | 2030 to 2031 | |----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------| | Nil | Nil | Nil | Nil | Nil | Nil | This measure is not expected to have an Exchequer impact. ## Macroeconomic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. ## Impact on individuals, households and families The measure is not expected to have any direct impact on individuals as ATED and the availability of ATED relief only applies to companies, collective investment schemes and partnerships with company members. This measure is not expected to impact on family formation, stability or breakdown. ## Equalities impacts This measure only affects businesses, therefore it is not anticipated that there will be disproportionate impacts on those in groups sharing protected characteristics. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations There are expected to be no impacts for businesses as the amendment ensures that the policy works as originally intended. The measure is not expected to impact civil society organisations. ## Operational impact (\u00a3 million) (HMRC or other) It is not expected that there will be any operational costs in implementing this measure. The measure will not require any changes to HMRC's systems and processes. ## Other impacts Other impacts have been considered and none have been identified. ## Monitoring and evaluation The measure will be monitored through customer engagement and from information collected in returns. ## Further advice If you have any questions about this change, contact the HMRC Stamp Taxes team by email stamptaxes.budgetfinancebill@hmrc.gov.uk.

It will also impact personal representatives, their advisors and pension scheme administrators. General description of the measure This measure will bring most unused pension funds and pension death benefits within the value of a person's estate for Inheritance Tax purposes from 6 April 2027. Personal Representatives will be liable for reporting and paying any Inheritance Tax due on unused pension funds and pension death benefits. Death in service benefits payable from a registered pension scheme and dependant's scheme pensions from a defined benefit arrangement, or from a collective money purchase arrangement, are excluded from these changes and will not be in scope of Inheritance Tax. ## Policy objective This measure removes distortions which have led to pension schemes being increasingly used and marketed as a tax planning vehicle to transfer wealth, rather than for funding retirement. It also removes inconsistencies in the Inheritance Tax treatment of di ff erent types of pensions. ## Background to the measure In recent years, pension schemes have been increasingly used and marketed as a tax planning tool to transfer wealth without an Inheritance Tax charge, rather than for funding retirement. This has been exacerbated by certain changes in pensions tax policy over the past decade, such as the introduction of pension freedoms in 2015 and the abolition of the lifetime allowance in March 2023. At present, individuals can accumulate unlimited tax-free savings in their pension, draw on other means to fund their retirement and leave their unused pension assets to be inherited by beneficiaries without any Inheritance Tax charge. A further factor is a di ff erence in the Inheritance Tax treatment of di ff erent types of pension schemes. Some UK pension schemes (for example, the NHS and judicial schemes) are non-discretionary schemes, which are treated as part of an individual's estate for Inheritance Tax purposes. However, most UK pension schemes are discretionary schemes. Unused pension funds in discretionary schemes can currently be passed on to beneficiaries after death without any Inheritance Tax charge. At Autumn Budget 2024, the government announced several measures to reform Inheritance Tax and deliver fairer, less economically distortive tax treatment of inherited wealth and assets, including this measure. Between 30 October 2024 and 22 January 2025, the government consulted on the process for reporting and paying Inheritance Tax on unused pension funds and pension death benefits, proposing that pension scheme administrators would be liable for reporting and paying"}, {"file": "Inheritance Tax \u2014 unused pension funds and death benefits - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "any Inheritance Tax on the pension element of an individual's estate. The government published a summary of responses and a formal response to the technical consultation on 21 July 2025. This announced that personal representatives, rather than pension scheme administrators, will be liable for reporting and paying any Inheritance Tax due on unused pension funds and pension death benefits from 6 April 2027. It also confirmed that death in service benefits payable from a registered pension scheme will remain out of scope of Inheritance Tax. At Budget 2025 the government set out further detail on the process to implement these changes. The government will introduce a mechanism for personal representatives to direct pension scheme administrators to withhold benefits and to pay Inheritance Tax due on unused pension funds or pension death benefits to support them in administering the estate. This will be available in limited circumstances to reduce the impact on pension beneficiaries. Personal representatives will also be discharged from liability for pensions discovered after they have received clearance for settling the Inheritance Tax due on the estate, if HMRC are satisfied that they have made every e ff ort to locate the deceased's pensions. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date This measure will take e ff ect in respect of deaths on or after 6 April 2027. ## Current law Inheritance Tax legislation is provided for in the Inheritance Tax Act 1984. Pensions tax legislation is included in: Part 4 of Finance Act 2004 (as amended by subsequent Finance Acts and supporting regulations) The Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 The Taxes Management Act 1970 ## Proposed revisions The government will introduce legislation in Finance Bill 2025-26 to include the value of unused pension funds and pension death benefits within the member's estate on their death, regardless of whether the pension scheme administrators or scheme trustees have discretion over the payment of any death benefits. The pension death benefits, to which section 5(2) of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 currently applies where there is no relevant discretion, will be included within the deceased's estate even where relevant discretion exists, with some exceptions. Death in service benefits payable from both discretionary and non-discretionary registered pension schemes will be excluded from Inheritance Tax. The existing Inheritance Tax principles providing exemption for death benefits passing to a surviving spouse or civil partner, and registered charities will be maintained. Legislation will be updated to provide the right framework to allow PSAs and PRs to exchange all the necessary information for Inheritance Tax purposes and Income Tax if due on inherited pensions. ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3 million) | 2026to | |-----------| | 2027 2028 | These figures were set out in Table 4.2 of Budget 2025 and have been certified by the O ffi ce for Budget Responsibility. More details can be found in the policy costings document published alongside Autumn Budget 2024. ## Macroeconomic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. ## Impact"}, {"file": "Inheritance Tax \u2014 unused pension funds and death benefits - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "on individuals, households and families Inheritance Tax is a wealth transfer tax which is usually levied on the estate (the property, money and possessions) of someone who has died. It can also apply to some transfers made during a person's lifetime and on assets held within trusts. From 6 April 2027, this measure will increase Inheritance Tax liabilities for estates which contain inheritable pension wealth and will reduce the inheritance received by beneficiaries. HMRC does not hold complete data on the beneficiaries of estates because it is not required for the administration of the tax. Most estates will continue to have no Inheritance Tax liability after 6 April 2027. The government estimates that, of around 213,000 estates with inheritable pension wealth in 2027 to 2028, 10,500 estates will have an Inheritance Tax liability where previously they would not. Approximately 38,500 estates will pay more Inheritance Tax than would previously have been the case. The average Inheritance Tax liability is expected to increase by around \u00a334,000 when pension assets are included in the value of the estate. These estimates are static and do not take into account potential behavioural changes, such as tax planning or drawing down pension funds faster, which may reduce the number of estates a ff ected, as such, these projections should be viewed as a maximum. The Exchequer impact section above includes the expected behavioural response. The process for managing the deceased's estates (including Inheritance Tax) already impacts personal representatives, the deceased's beneficiaries, and pension scheme administrators. Around 75% of IHT400 forms, which are used to report the assets and liabilities in the deceased's estate, are submitted by agents, with the remaining 25% coming from non-professional personal representatives. Personal representatives already report and pay Inheritance Tax on the deceased's estate, including for non-discretionary pension schemes. They will now be required to report and pay the Inheritance Tax due on discretionary pensions, but all parties will need to work together to do this. Personal representatives will need to collect and share information from all the deceased's pension schemes and pension beneficiaries. They already need to contact all the pension schemes but will now need to collect information if needed for filing an IHT400 form. This measure will require personal representatives, in addition, to report the amount of tax attributable to each pension scheme and provides them with the option to direct pension scheme administrators to pay the Inheritance Tax due on pensions or reimburse personal representatives for the Inheritance Tax already paid. If personal representatives direct pension scheme administrators to withhold funds this will impact pension scheme beneficiaries who will only be able to access 50% of the deceased's pension death benefits which may be subject to IHT, for up to 15 months after the date of death. This delay is to ensure that enough money is held back to cover any potential IHT liability. In many cases pension scheme beneficiaries will not be a ff ected because the personal representative will not ask the pension scheme to"}, {"file": "Inheritance Tax \u2014 unused pension funds and death benefits - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "withhold funds. Generally, pension beneficiaries will be jointly liable for any Inheritance Tax due on the pension and solely liable for Inheritance Tax due on any future pensions that are discovered after a clearance certificate has been granted to the personal representatives. Beneficiaries may need to make choices about how and when Inheritance Tax should be paid on their benefits. The majority of estates will not be liable for Inheritance Tax and therefore have no additional interaction with HMRC. Personal representatives of estates with inheritable pensions wealth, particularly those which are liable for Inheritance Tax, will be a ff ected as they will be required to carry out additional administration. HMRC will mitigate this impact by providing personal representatives, pension scheme administrators and beneficiaries with clear guidance, an Inheritance Tax Checker Tool to advise whether Inheritance Tax is due, and a straightforward system to pay the tax liability. This measure is expected to have an impact on families going through bereavement where the estate has inheritable pension wealth and an Inheritance Tax liability, in relation to additional administration of the estate. ## Equalities impacts This measure will a ff ect estates of deceased individuals, where there is inherited pension wealth, and the estate is liable to Inheritance Tax. The majority of Inheritance Tax is paid by estates of individuals aged 75 or over (79%). Inheritance Tax is also paid by the estate of slightly more females than males. One reason for this is that marriages and civil partnerships in the UK are predominantly between opposite sex individuals, as outlined by the O ffi ce for National Statistics (ONS). Men generally die at a younger age and those in a marriage or civil partnership will normally pass on all, or a large percentage, of their estate to their spouse or civil partner tax-free. For the period 2020 to 2022 life expectancy at birth in the UK was 4 years longer for females, according to the ONS. HMRC does not hold data on the other protected characteristics of deceased individuals with estates liable for Inheritance Tax and so cannot determine conclusively if there are any other equality impacts. This measure will also have an impact on the beneficiaries liable to Inheritance Tax, where there is inherited pension wealth since those beneficiaries will receive inheritance of lower value once the tax has been paid. HMRC does not hold protected characteristic data on the beneficiaries of estates or pension schemes and so cannot determine conclusively if there are any equality impacts. ## Administrative Impact on business including civil society organisations This measure will have a significant impact on certain businesses, both those providing professional personal representative services and pension schemes. Professional personal representatives will be impacted by additional responsibilities relating to the pension asset. Pension scheme administrators will have new duties to support personal representatives in paying Inheritance Tax on pensions (including the Pensions Direct Payment Scheme). The impacts for individual personal representatives are set out in the 'Impacts on Individuals, families and households'"}, {"file": "Inheritance Tax \u2014 unused pension funds and death benefits - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "section. Businesses, including professional personal representatives and pension schemes, will incur one-o ff costs as a result of this measure. One-o ff costs may include overall business familiarisation with the changes, upskilling sta ff on process changes, and updating software to facilitate the new Inheritance Tax reporting requirements. The one-o ff costs to professional personal representatives and pension schemes are estimated at \u00a365 million. Ongoing costs will include new responsibilities for pension scheme administrators to share more information with the personal representatives, about all benefits (not just lump sums). Pension scheme administrators will also have to set up and run internal IT systems to o ff er the Pensions Inheritance Tax Payment Scheme. Schemes will also need to establish systems for the new process which will allow personal representatives to request the pension scheme administrator withhold a portion of the pension asset. There will also be new obligations to communicate the potential tax consequences of decisions to members and their beneficiaries. Personal representatives will face increased costs as a result of being liable for reporting and paying the Inheritance Tax, although they will not be liable for Inheritance Tax on any pensions discovered after a clearance certificate has been granted. Ongoing costs for both pension schemes and professional personal representatives are estimated to be \u00a35 million. These estimates reflect the total impact across all businesses; however, these costs will be subject to significant variation between individual businesses. As most estates will remain out of scope of Inheritance Tax, ongoing costs will only apply where pension schemes or personal representatives are managing or administering pensions or estates in scope of these changes. This measure is expected on balance to a ff ect businesses' experience of dealing with HMRC as in a minority of cases it will require professional personal representatives, agents, and beneficiaries to add to their existing administrative processes relating to estates. As with non-professionals, HMRC will mitigate this impact by supporting businesses with clear guidance, an Inheritance Tax Checker Tool to advise whether Inheritance Tax is due, and a straightforward system of payment. The proposal is expected to have a negligible impact on civil society organisations such as those who support bereaved families and provide advice on relevant issues (for example, Citizens Advice). This may include one-o ff costs such as familiarisation. ## Estimated one-o ff impact on transitional businesses costs (\u00a3 million) | One-o ff impact (\u00a3 million) Costs 65 Savings negligible | |------------------------------------------------------------------| ## Estimated continuing impact on administrative burden (\u00a3 million) | Continuing average annual impact (\u00a3 million) Costs 5 Savings negligible Net impact on annual administrative burden +5 | |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| ## Operational impact (\u00a3 million) (HMRC or other) To support delivery of this policy, HMRC will incur additional resource costs and will need to make changes to its IT systems and services.

On average, all but the richest 10% of households will benefit as a percentage of income from policy decisions in 2028-29.

This shows that government policy continues to be highly redistributive, and that in 2028-29: - on average, the bottom and middle of the income distribution -60% of all households -will receive more in public spending than they contribute in tax - on average, households in the lowest income decile will receive over four times as much in public spending than they pay in tax Figure 1.C Overall level of public spending received, and tax paid, as a percentage of net income, by income decile, in 2028-29 180% Source: HM Treasury distributional analysis model ## Chapter 2 ## Data sources and methodology ## Table 2.A Data sources for charts Figure Source | 1.A to 1.C | Internal HMTreasury modelling.

The chart accounts for those modelled measures announced from Autumn Budget 2024 onwards. - 2.3 Throughout, measures are only included if they have a clear firstorder impact on the benefit income, tax paid, or the benefits-in-kind received through public services by UK residents. The following policy impacts are therefore outside the scope of this analysis: - the impact of changes to regulation, for example the National Living Wage, which are not direct changes to the distribution of tax or public spending - the behavioural impacts of most measures, for example where households might reduce consumption to reduce the amount of tax they might otherwise pay - impacts resulting from reduced fraud, error or debt in the welfare system, as full compliance with the rules of the welfare system is assumed throughout the modelling - impacts resulting from reduced tax non-compliance, as full compliance with the rules of the tax system is assumed throughout the modelling. Anti-avoidance measures are captured where they result in a change in tax liabilities in the year being analysed - impacts of decisions made by devolved administrations - impacts of taxes where the incidence of the tax does not fall directly on households, for example employer National Insurance contributions. We exclude such taxes from this analysis as we are unable to robustly determine the distributional consequences of how they all could be passed through to households - the impact of measures without a direct impact in 2028-29 - the impact of supply-side growth policies that may indirectly impact households, for example through increases in employment or higher wages 2.4 Additionally, measures are routinely excluded from this analysis where there is insufficient data to robustly model the distributional impacts. ## Defining household living standards 2.5 The analysis in this document uses household income as the measure of household living standards. While this is considered a standard approach, income may not always best represent some households' general standard of living, as some households may finance their expenditure using wealth rather than income, or experience periods of low income temporarily (for example households containing students, the temporarily unemployed, or the selfemployed). The most recent analysis by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has shown that, of those surveyed in 2022-23, 60% of those in the bottom quintile in 2015-16 were in a higher income quintile in 2022-23. 2.6 An alternative approach to approximating household living standards is to use household expenditure. While there is a strong correlation between income and expenditure, there are many households with both low income and high expenditure (and vice versa) -approximately 20% of households in the bottom income decile are in the top half of the expenditure distribution, for example. Due to a lack of data on expenditure in"}, {"file": "Impact_on_households.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "some of the datasets used in this analysis, an expenditure-based approach is not used here. However, the impact of government decisions on low-income households should be considered in the context of these methodological choices. ## Defining income and ranking households 2.7 This distributional analysis uses equivalised net household income, before housing costs, as the main indicator by which to rank households from lowest income to highest income. This indicator is comprised of several components: - 'Equivalised': equivalisation is a process that adjusts a household's net income to take into account the fact that larger households will require a higher net income to achieve the same standard of living as a household with fewer members. The equivalisation factors used in the analysis are the modified OECD factors (as also used in DWP's Households Below Average Income publication) - 'Net': household incomes are ranked after deductions from direct taxes, and after additions from welfare benefits. Deductions from indirect taxes, or additions through benefits-in-kind from public services, are not used to rank households - 'Household': incomes are assessed in aggregate at the household, not individual level. Comparing household, rather than individual, incomes reduces the subjectivity of this analysis, ensuring that no assumptions are made about how incomes or expenditure are shared between separate individuals within the household - 'Before housing costs': housing costs, such as rent or the cost of servicing a mortgage, are not deducted from household incomes - 2.8 The household income distribution is created by ranking households from the lowest equivalised net income to the highest equivalised net income, and then dividing this ranking into ten equally sized groups called deciles, across which the analysis is produced. - 2.9 To provide an approximation of where different households might be found in the income distribution, Table 2.C shows estimated median gross incomes (pre-tax private income including earnings, private pensions, savings and investments, plus benefit income) within each decile. This is a less precise estimate of a household's position in the income distribution than net income, but is easier to understand because many people think about their incomes or salaries in gross rather than net terms. - 2.10 For example, if a household consisting of two adults has a gross income of \u00a333,900 per year between them, there is a high likelihood that this household will be found in the third income decile. However, this is not guaranteed, as different gross household incomes can result in different net household incomes, depending on how many earners there are in the household, the size of the household, and for which benefits the household qualifies. Table 2.C Median gross income for each decile (\u00a3 per year, 2028-29) for different household compositions 2 | Median gross income of households in decile | 1 adult | 1 adult and 1 child | 2 adults | 2 adults and 1 child | 2 adults and 2 children | |-----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------|------------|------------------------|---------------------------| | Top decile | 103,700 | - | 139,900 | 191,500 | 240,000 | | Ninth decile | 65,700"}, {"file": "Impact_on_households.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "| - | 93,800 | 120,500 | 151,400 | | Eighth decile | 50,900 | - | 74,800 | 100,100 | 123,900 | | Seventh decile | 42,400 | - | 63,100 | 81,200 | 101,300 | | Sixth decile | 36,200 | 50,000 | 54,000 | 71,100 | 85,000 | | Fifth decile | 31,400 | 44,400 | 46,300 | 61,000 | 73,700 | | Fourth decile | 26,700 | 34,600 | 40,000 | 50,800 | 62,200 | | Third decile | 22,300 | 29,400 | 33,900 | 42,200 | 51,600 | | Second decile | 18,200 | 24,300 | 28,100 | 35,500 | 42,900 | | Bottom decile | 13,100 | 17,900 | 20,100 | 23,700 | 28,900 | Source: HM Treasury distributional analysis model ## Tax, welfare and public service spending methodology ## Tax and welfare 2.11 Where possible, tax and welfare policy changes are analysed using HM Treasury's Intra -Governmental Tax and Benefit Microsimulation model (IGOTM), which is underpinned by data from the ONS's Living Costs and Food (LCF) survey. The sample size of the LCF means that in order to produce robust analysis three years of data have been pooled together, specifically 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2022-23 3 . This data is then projected forward to reflect the financial year being modelled. The analysis uses historical Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings microdata on earnings growth at different points across the income distribution as well as the latest Office for Budget Responsibility average earnings and inflation forecasts. The model generally makes no changes to the underlying demographics, employment levels or expenditure patterns in the base data. 2.12 Not all measures can be reliably modelled using IGOTM due to data and/or modelling constraints.

This is done according to the Exchequer costs or savings from the measures, applied to households based on where the impacts are likely to fall. - 2.13 Within the tax system, the main taxes microsimulated in this analysis generally include: Income Tax, employee and self-employed National Insurance contributions, Council Tax, VAT, Insurance Premium Tax, Fuel Duty, Alcohol Duty, Tobacco Duty, Stamp Duty Land Tax, and Air Passenger Duty. - 2.14 Within the welfare system, the most significant welfare benefits microsimulated in this analysis generally include: the State Pension, Pension Credit, Winter Fuel Payments, Attendance Allowance, Jobseeker's Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, Hous ing Benefit, Universal Credit, Child Benefit, Disability Living Allowance, Personal Independence Payment and Tax-Free Childcare. - 2.15 Not all households take up all the benefits to which they are entitled. HM Treasury's microsimulation modelling takes this into account when calculating the effects of policy changes by using information on the take-up of benefits in the underlying survey data. This methodology provides"}, {"file": "Impact_on_households.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "a more accurate estimate of the impact of welfare changes on households. - 2.16 Modelling of tax and welfare measures in IGOTM takes into account the devolution of decisions in some areas from the UK government to devolved administrations. UK government decisions are modelled as applying only to households directly affected by the measure, while decisions taken by the devolved administrations are not included as policy impacts. - 2.17 In general, all charts in Chapter 1 assume that Universal Credit has been fully rolled out and claimants are no longer claiming benefits under the older legacy system. However, where measures relate directly to migration of legacy benefits, adjustments are made to account for these impacts. ## Public service spending 2.18 The analysis of public service spending is aimed at quantifying the benefit that frontline public services provide to households. This covers services provided by the Department of Health and Social Care, the Department for Education, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department for Transport, the Ministry of Justice, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and some services delivered by local government in England. 2.19 Public service spending estimates used in this analysis include the cost of providing the public services, including employment costs where relevant. This analysis excludes: - administrative spending - capital spending and the depreciation of capital assets - spending on public goods where it is not possible to identify the direct benefits from these areas of spending for specific households 2.20 To align with the definition of income used in DWP's Households Below Average Income publication, the analysis of spending on public services also includes student loans. To account for this source of income, estimates of student loan outlay in a given financial year are counted as household income from public spending. Likewise, estimates of student loan repayments in that same financial year are reflected as a loss to households, again through the public spending bars. 2.21 Figures 1.A and 1.B illustrate the impact of changes to public service spending in 2028-29 compared to a counterfactual of planned spending at Spring Budget 2024. This analysis uses detailed spending plans for 2028-29 (as announced at Spending Review 2025). 2.22 Charts are presented on a UK basis, though any public service spending that is the responsibility of the devolved administrations is not reflected in this analysis. This means that any changes to devolved spending -whether positive or negative -have no impact on this analysis. 2.23 The analysis of the benefits-in-kind provided by public service spending is, as with tax and welfare measures, derived from HM Treasury's IGOTM model. However, the modelling approach taken for public services is slightly different. 2.24 Where the use of a public service is reported in the LCF, no additional data is required and the approach is similar to that used for most tax and welfare modelling. The spending on a particular public service is allocated between all those households who are expected to use this public service, in proportion to each household's"}, {"file": "Impact_on_households.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "expected use of the service. 2.25 Where information about the use of a service is not available in the LCF, additional data sources are required. This additional data is used to identify characteristics associated with the use of the service and then used to derive probabilities of service use conditional on these characteristics. The cash value spent on public services is converted into a one-for-one cash gain to households and distributed to households based on the probability that any given household uses the service. ## Continuous improvements to modelling and analysis 2.26 The modelling underpinning our analysis of tax, welfare and public service spending is under continuous improvement, to enable us to provide the best estimate (subject to time, resource, and data constraints) of how households are impacted by the cumulative tax, welfare and public service spending decisions made by the government. 2.27 We also aim to capture the most comprehensive and up-to-date record of where government spending is directed to inform this analysis, noting this will continue to evolve as final departmental spending lines are decided. As such, the charts in Chapter 1 represent our best estimates of impacts at the time of publishing. 2.28 Finally, the analysis shown in our charts is based on the latest available Office for Budget Responsibility forecast. For these reasons, as well as those set out above, charts published at consecutive fiscal events are not directly comparable. ## HM Treasury contacts This document can be downloaded from www.gov.uk If you require this information in an alternative format or have general enquiries about HM Treasury and its work, contact: Correspondence Team HM Treasury 1 Horse Guards Road London SW1A 2HQ Tel: 020 7270 5000 Email: public.enquiries@hmtreasury.gov.uk"}, {"file": "Capping Inheritance Tax trust charges for excluded property in trusts at 30 October 2024 - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "Contents Who is likely to be affected ## General description of the measure Policy objective Background to the measure Detailed proposal Further advice Policy paper ## Capping Inheritance Tax trust charges for excluded property in trusts at 30 October 2024 Published 26 November 2025 Contents Who is likely to be affected General description of the measure Policy objective Background to the measure Detailed proposal Summary of impacts Monitoring and evaluation Further advice ## \u00a9 Crown copyright 2025 This publication is licensed under the terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0 except where otherwise stated.

The relevant property charges are capped at \u00a35 million over each 10 year cycle. This cap applies to settled property which was excluded property at 30 October 2024, and that is situated outside the UK at the time of the relevant charge. ## Policy objective The government is committed to addressing unfairness in the tax system, so that everyone who is long-term resident in the UK pays their taxes here. From 6 April 2025, the government removed the outdated concept of domicile status from the tax system and implemented a new residence-based regime which is internationally competitive and focused on attracting the best talent and investment to the UK. Under the new rules, when an individual is a long-term UK resident (broadly, they have been resident 10 years out of the last 20) non-UK assets they own personally, or in a trust they created, are in scope for Inheritance Tax. The reform included transitional protections for former non-domiciled individuals, so that non-UK property in former excluded property trusts is not brought into inheritance tax on their death. This additional measure provides a limit in respect of trust charges arising every 10 years, or on exits. The cap relates to each trust in scope. Trustees remain liable to pay tax up to the cap amount, making a significant contribution to the exchequer, in addition to tax impacted individuals are expected to pay by remaining in the UK, as well as their wider economic contribution. New trusts, or trusts created by individuals who were not formerly non-domiciled remain chargeable in full. ## Background to the measure This measure was announced at Budget 2025. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date This measure will have retrospective effect from 6 April 2025. ## Current law Sections 44 to 46 Finance Act 2025 and Schedule 13"}, {"file": "Capping Inheritance Tax trust charges for excluded property in trusts at 30 October 2024 - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "introduced changes to the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 (IHTA) to provide for a system where non-UK assets owned outright or in settlements come into scope based on an individual's longterm UK residence. The current law for relevant property trusts is contained in Part 3, Chapter 3 of the IHTA. ## Proposed revisions New section 75B will be added to the IHTA to provide for a relevant property trust's future tax charges to be capped. ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3 million) | 2025 to 2026 | 2026 to 2027 | 2027 to 2028 | 2028 to 2029 | 2029 to 2030 | 2030 to 2031 | |----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------| | Nil | -5 | +110 | +155 | +140 | +110 | The costing for this measure has been incorporated, alongside other measures, into the overall 'Cap trust charges at \u00a35 million for pre-30 October 2024 excluded property trusts for charges applying from 6 April 2025 and close post-departure trade profits loophole from 6 April 2026' costing. More details can be found in Table 4.1 of Budget 2025. ## Macroeconomic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. ## Impact on individuals, households and families This measure will improve the residence-based regime to retain a small number of former non-domiciled individuals who settled property into trust. Trusts they settled can elect to cap subsequent Inheritance Tax charges on former excluded property. Individuals will need to familiarise themselves with the change. This measure is not expected to impact on family formation, stability or breakdown. This measure is expected overall to have no impact on individuals' experience of dealing with HMRC as the change is an improvement to the existing residencebased regime. ## Equalities impacts An individual may be affected by this measure regardless of their protected characteristics. HMRC does not currently hold data on the protected characteristics of individuals impacted by this measure and so cannot make an assessment of the impacts on those with shared protected characteristics. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations There is no impact on businesses as this measure only affects trusts and estates. Trusts and estates practitioners and advisers may have one-off familiarisation costs and upskilling staff. It is not expected there will be ongoing costs. This measure is expected overall to have no impact on business experience of dealing with HMRC as this change is a revision to the legislation to ensure it works as intended. ## Operational impact (\u00a3 million) (HMRC or other) There are no changes to HMRC IT systems. A minor change to reporting forms and associated guidance notes will also be made. HMRC processing and compliance resources are not impacted. Appropriate taxpayer guidance will be published on GOV.UK. ## Other impacts Other impacts have been considered and none have been identified. ## Monitoring and evaluation The measure will be monitored through Inheritance Tax receipts data, plus communication with affected taxpayers and practitioners. ## Further advice If you have any questions about this change, email:"}, {"file": "Capping Inheritance Tax trust charges for excluded property in trusts at 30 October 2024 - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "personaltaxinternational@hmrc.gov.uk.

This publication is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/venture-capital-trusts2025/venture-capital-trusts-statistics-2025 ## 1. Main findings The number of Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs) managing funds has increased in the tax year 2023 to 2024 whilst the amount of investment raised by VCTs has decreased compared to 2022 to 2023. The amount of investment Income Tax relief is claimed on decreased in 2023 to 2024, reflecting the decrease in funds raised by VCTs in that tax year. ## 1.1 Headlines - Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs) issued shares to the value of \u00a3873 million in 2023 to 2024, which is a 17% decrease in comparison to the 2022 to 2023 figure of \u00a31,051 million - the number of VCTs raising funds has remained consistent in the 2023 to 2024 tax year - the number of VCTs managing funds has increased by 2, to 51 in the tax year 2023 to 2024 - in 2023 to 2024, Venture Capital Trust (VCT) investors claimed Income Tax (IT) relief on \u00a3810 million of investment. This is a decrease of 19% from 2022 to 2023 - the number of VCT investors who claimed Income Tax relief has decreased by 9% to 24,085 in 2023 to 2024 ## 2. Introduction ## 2.1 About these statistics This is an annual National Statistics publication of Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs) statistics. Section 3 (number of VCTs and funds raised) includes figures covering the period up to tax year 2023 to 2024. This section utilizes HMRC administrative data, improving the quality of the underlying data. Section 4 (investors claiming relief on VCT investments) includes first estimates for 2023 to 2024. The deadline for submitting Self Assessment returns for the tax year 2023 to 2024 was 31 January 2025 but individuals may submit late claims. Therefore, the data for 2023 to 2024 is partial for this publication and has been uplifted to account for potential late returns. Further information about the data sources and methodology can be found in the Background Quality Report. In Table 1, figures for the 2022 to 2023 tax year are revised and are provisional for the 2023 to 2024 tax year. In Tables 2a and 2b, figures prior to the 2023 to 2024 tax year are revised.

The VCT scheme, introduced in 1995, is one of three tax-based venture capital schemes that were active in the 2023 to 2024 tax year. VCTs raise funds for investments, normally annually, through new and/or top-up share issues to investors. For more information about Venture Capital Trusts and the policy background, see the Venture Capital Trusts statistics: Introductory note (https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/venture-capital-trusts-statistics-introductorynote). ## 3. Amount of funds raised and number of Venture Capital Trusts Values listed under 'new series' utilise HMRC administrative data which improves the quality of the underlying data. Values listed under 'old series' provide information on the number of VCTs and funds raised are obtained from publicly available internet sources, mainly FE Investegate VCTs information and news announcements (https://www.investegate.co.uk/). From the tax year 2022 to 2023, only the new series will be reported. In the 2026 release of the publication, comparisons between the new and old series between 2019 to 2020 and 2021 to 2022 will be removed, reporting only the values in the new series. Table 1 provides information for tax years 2022 to 2023 onward using new administrative data only. It also provides a comparison between the old and new series for tax years 2019 to 2020 to 2021 to 2022 which show that both series follow the same trends and any differences between the two series are small. The funds raised shown by both series increase over the three years, reaching a peak in 2021 to 2022. The number of VCTs raising and managing funds between tax year 2019 to 2020 and tax year 2021 to 2022 also follow the same trend across the two series, with a difference of just one VCT raising funds in 2021 to 2022 and one VCT managing funds in 2019 to 2020. Amounts raised have been rounded to the nearest \u00a35 million for data up to 2016 to 2017 and \u00a31 million for 2017 to 2018 onward.

From the 2019 to 2020 tax year, funds raised are presented using the new series, with the change in series marked by the black vertical dashed line. The amount of funds raised by VCTs has been on a rising trend in recent years and has more than doubled since the 2009 to 2010 tax year. Much of this increase is likely due to the increasing appeal of the tax benefits of VCT investment as an alternative or addition to pension investment where allowances have been reduced or capped in the same period. This made traditional pensions less attractive, and the introduction of pension freedoms, which allow for cash to be taken out of the pot for investment, rather than buying an annuity, means there is also more freedom for investment in alternatives such as VCTs. Whilst the impacts of Covid-19 would have affected the end of the 2019 to 2020 tax year, funds raised in 2020 to 2021 increased slightly despite covering the main pandemic period. Funds raised in the 2021 to 2022 tax year increased substantially which may be, in part, the result of a strong recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Additionally, the VCT market broadly follows the wider venture capital market and 2021 to 2022 was a particularly strong fundraising year for the venture capital industry. In the tax year 2022 to 2023, the slight decrease in amount of funds raised is likely a reflection of a slowdown in the wider venture capital industry, but the value of funds raised remained the second highest on record. This trend is continued into the 2023 to 2024 tax year with a further decrease in the value of funds raised, again following the trends seen in the wider venture capital industry. It is worth noting that despite the decrease of funds raised experienced in 2023 to 2024, the values raised by VCTs still remain the third highest on record. Figure 2: Number of VCTs raising and managing funds, 1995 to 1996 to 2023 to 2024 Figure 2 reports the number of VCTs raising and managing funds using the old series for tax year 1995 to 1996 to tax year 2018 to 2019. From tax year 2019 to 2020 onwards, funds raised are presented using the new series. The change in series is marked by the black vertical dashed line. The number of VCTs raising funds in 2023 to 2024 has remained consistent at 45. In the past, the amount of funds raised by VCTs and the number of VCTs raising funds have been closely linked. However, this has been less evident in recent years where similar amounts of funds have been raised by a smaller number of large VCTs. This trend continued in to 2022 to 2023"}, {"file": "Venture Capital Trusts statistics: 2025 - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "with funds raised reaching the second highest level but the number of VCTs raising funds remaining consistent. In 2023 to 2024 there is a further decrease in the value of funds raised, whilst the number of VCTs raising funds remains consistent. There has been a significant decrease in the amount raised by VCTs in 2023 to 2024 compared to the levels of funds raised in 2022 to 2023. As shown in Figure 2, VCTs have been merging over time to achieve economies of scale. However, it is worth noting that there are still new entrants into the VCT industry. VCTs managing funds include VCTs which raised funds in the tax year and also those VCTs which managed funds raised in previous years. The number of VCTs managing funds has increased in 2023 to 2024 due to new entrants into the VCT market. Since 2010 to 2011, the number of VCTs managing funds has generally been decreasing, dropping to 51 in 2023 to 2024. ## 4. Investors claiming Income Tax relief and amounts invested The amount of VCT investment on which Income Tax relief was claimed decreased by 19% in 2023 to 2024, compared to the previous year. The number of investors has decreased by 9% to 24,085 in 2023 to 2024. This information only covers claims made through Self Assessment and will not cover investors making Income Tax relief claims through other systems (for example PAYE) or those not making any claims. Table 2a and Table 2b present the distribution of investors claiming Income Tax relief under the VCT scheme, and the amounts invested, respectively. Total figures provided in Tables 2a and 2b on the amount of investment on which Income Tax relief was claimed are not directly comparable with the figures on the amount of investment received by VCTs in a tax year shown in Table 1, as some relief could be claimed outside Self Assessment, or not claimed at all. ## 4.1 Number of investors claiming VCT relief Most investors tend to invest under \u00a350,000 into VCT funds. The average amount invested by an individual in the 2023 to 2024 tax year was around \u00a334,000. Numbers have been rounded to the nearest 5. Totals may not sum due to rounding.

It was thought that the Covid-19 pandemic may have acted to reduce investment towards the end of 2019 to 2020 as uncertainty increased across the economy. However, the increase in investment in 2020 to 2021 suggests Covid-19 impacts may have been lower than expected, or they tempered what would have been a greater increase than is seen in the data in 2020 to 2021. This increase in investment was further shown in 2021 to 2022, with it being a record-breaking year for VCT investment. This was likely driven by a strong rebound from the Covid-19 pandemic and a particularly strong year for the wider venture capital industry. Investment in 2022 to 2023 decreased compared to 2021 to 2022, indicating a slight slowdown in the venture capital market but it still remained a strong year for investment. This decrease in investment continued into 2023 to 2024 in line with the general slow down seen in the venture capital market. Figure 3 shows the distribution of investors claiming VCT relief grouped by size of investment. Around 82% of VCT investors claimed tax relief under the VCT scheme for an investment of \u00a350,000 or less; the largest number being in the \u00a35,000 to \u00a310,000 group with 17% of the total followed closely by the \u00a325,000 to \u00a350,000 group with 16% of the total. In 2023 to 2024 the proportion of VCT investors in the higher investment size categories (above \u00a325,000) decreased slightly compared to the 2022 to 2023 tax year. Figure 4: Number of investors claiming VCT relief via Self Assessment, 2004 to 2005 to 2023 to 2024 Figure 4 shows a time series of the number of investors who have claimed VCT relief from tax years 2004 to 2005 to 2023 to 2024. The increase in investors between 2005 to 2006 and 2018 to 2019, as well as the rise in funds raised between this period shown in table 1, reflect the impacts of the pension changes and the Patient Capital Review. The tax year 2021 to 2022 saw an increase in the number of investors. This continued into 2022 to 2023 which saw the highest number of investors since 2004 to 2005. In the 2023 to 2024 tax year, the number of investors decreased by 10% compared to the 2022 to 2023 tax year. ## 4.2 Amounts invested by VCT investors Table 2b shows a decrease of 19% in the amount of relief claimed by VCT investors in 2023 to 2024.

More precisely, 32% of the total amount invested is accounted for by only 6% of investors. Figure 6: Comparison of the amount of investment on which relief was claimed via Self Assessment and total funds raised (\u00a3 million), 2004 to 2005 to 2023 to 2024 Figure 6 shows that the amount of relief claimed, and total funds raised by VCTs follow largely consistent trends year on year. From tax year 2019 to 2020, funds raised are presented using the new series. The change in series is marked by the black vertical dashed line. In the 2023 to 2024 tax year, approximately 92% of the total VCT investments were claimed through Self Assessment. The remaining amounts are assumed to be either claimed outside Self Assessment or not claimed at all. The tax year 2021 to 2022 was a record-breaking year for the amount of investment Income Tax relief was claimed on, which is consistent with funds raised by VCTs in 2021 to 2022 reaching record breaking levels. In tax year 2022 to 2023 there was a decrease in the amount of relief claimed which was consistent with the decrease in funds raised by VCTs. This trend has continued into the 2023 to 2024 tax year with the decrease in relief claimed falling further, remaining in line with the decrease seen in funds raised by VCTs in this tax year. ## 5.

Executive summary This Budget takes the fair and necessary choices to deliver on the government's promise of change: - Cutting the cost of living by tackling inflation and taking around \u00a3150 off energy bills on average from April next year, and implementing a one-year freeze on regulated train fares and prescriptions charges. - Cutting the NHS waiting list in England, supported by 5.2 million more appointments delivered since the start of the Parliament and by creating 250 new Neighbourhood Health Centres. - Cutting debt and borrowing, to reduce the amount spent on debt interest rather than public services and to support the Bank of England to get inflation and interest rates down. These choices strengthen Britain's economic foundations and set the course for a secure future for the country. Since the start of this Parliament, Britain has: - Outperformed growth forecasts, with growth in 2025 upgraded to 1.5% from 1% in March, and is on course to be the second-fastest growing economy among G7 countries. - Seen real wages increase more than in the decade from 2010. - Struck three trade deals, with the US, India and the EU. The India free trade agreement alone could increase GDP by over 0.1% in the long term. - Seen the Bank of England cut interest rates five times. The choices taken at Autumn Budget 2024 and over the Parliament have begun to deliver on the government's mandate for change: - Increased funding to fix the NHS has seen waiting lists fall, with 5.2 million more appointments delivered. - Provided over \u00a3120 billion in additional capital investment for roads, rail and energy, including \u00a315.6 billion for major city-region transport. The Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimates that the uplift in public investment will raise potential output by around 0.4% over 10 years. - Implemented ambitious regulatory reforms with a target to reduce the annual admin burden on business by \u00a35.6 billion by the end of the Parliament. - Reformed the National Planning Policy Framework, delivering 170,000 additional homes and boosting GDP by 0.2% by 2029-30. The government's plans are underpinned by its"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "non-negotiable fiscal rules which provide credibility by ensuring day-to-day spending is met with revenues, while allowing the step change needed in investment to grow the economy. But, despite this progress, for many working people and businesses, the economy is not working well enough, and people are still struggling with the cost of living. Reflecting historical economic underperformance, the OBR has revised down its productivity forecast. In isolation this reduces the amount of revenue the OBR expects the government to collect by around \u00a316 billion in 2029-30. The government is determined to outperform this forecast by continuing its plans to grow the economy, protecting public services and cutting borrowing. But it is right to plan based on the independent forecaster's judgements, meaning, despite Britain's progress, the government needs to strengthen the public finances. So at Budget 2025, the government is doubling down on its plans and the economic and fiscal strategy it set last autumn by: - Relentlessly pursuing growth to create a secure future through an ambitious growth strategy, including supply-side reforms. The OBR's downgrade shows the imperative of this programme. - Taking the responsible choice to get borrowing down and increase the government's fiscal buffers. - Fixing the failings of the welfare system to stop people being written off due to sickness and to lift 450,000 children out of poverty. - Protecting and strengthening the NHS and other public services while ensuring public money is well spent. - Making the tax system fairer and fit for 21st-century Britain. - Taking decisive action to cut the cost of living and bring down inflation. ## Relentlessly pursuing growth The OBR's revised productivity outlook demonstrates the need for the government's supply-side reforms. At this Budget, the government is going further: - Investing for the future: This Budget protects increased public investment over the Parliament and delivers the infrastructure needed to drive growth. The government is also investing almost \u00a3900 million to complete the publicly funded works for the Lower Thames Crossing; boosting capital investment in the NHS by \u00a3300 million; and establishing the Leeds City Fund as a 25-year Business Rates Retention Zone, underlining its commitment to the Northern Growth Corridor. - The government is also making further planning reforms to accelerate delivery of housing and infrastructure; empowering local and regional leaders to boost growth in their areas; and strengthening the UK's nuclear capacities to increase energy security. - Backing business and unlocking innovation: The government is making it easier for entrepreneurs to start, scale and stay in the UK, with tax changes to incentivise greater investment into scaling companies, a new UK Listing Relief from Stamp Duty Reserve Tax, and reforms to the UK research and development (R&amp;D) system. This will support the UK's modern Industrial Strategy. The high street will benefit from permanently lower business rates for retail, hospitality and leisure, funded by higher rates for the most expensive properties such as warehouses used by large online retailers. The government will also stick to the commitments set out in the"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "corporate tax roadmap, to provide businesses certainty, and make targeted changes to the capital allowances treatment of main rate assets in a way that preserves the value of relief for future investment. - Unleashing talent and opportunity: The government is making over \u00a31.5 billion available across the spending review period into the Youth Guarantee and the Growth and Skills Levy. This will tackle the elevated number of people not in education, employment or training (NEET) rates, with the Youth Guarantee ensuring all young people aged 16-24 years old have access to the support they need to earn or learn. Reforms to the visa system will make sure UK businesses have access to the brightest and best global talent. ## Taking the responsible choice to get borrowing down and increase the government's fiscal buffers Budget 2025 continues to deliver the government's fiscal strategy: putting the public finances on a sustainable footing to give businesses and households the certainty they need, while increasing investment to grow the economy: - The government is cutting debt and borrowing - keeping to its tough fiscal rules. The OBR confirms the government is meeting the stability rule in 2029 -30 by \u00a321.7 billion and the investment rule by \u00a324.4 billion, and meeting the stability rule a year early. - The government is more than doubling the buffer against the stability rule. A higher buffer means more stability for working people and businesses, by reducing the need to change tax and spending plans when there are changes in the economy. - Policy at this Budget means borrowing falls in every year of the forecast with the UK forecast to reduce borrowing by more than any other G7 country. ## 1.1 Fixing the failings of the welfare system to stop people being written off due to sickness and to lift 450,000 children out of poverty The welfare system is not working as it should, forcing too many sick people out of work and on to benefits. Total spending on welfare grew by nearly a percentage point, as a share of GDP, over the last Parliament. The government is reforming the welfare system to tackle its failings. To stop people being written off due to sickness, the government is: - Rebalancing Universal Credit (UC) rates so that it doesn't pay to be off sick rather than work. - Tackling youth unemployment with a guaranteed job opportunity while commissioning Alan Milburn to conduct an independent report on young people, health and work. - Working with employers to support those who get sick to stay in work. The government is also: - Announcing new reforms to the tax breaks available to Motability and other qualifying schemes, raising over \u00a31 billion over the next five years. - Putting an end to those living abroad being able to buy cheap access to a UK State Pension. - Undertaking the Timms review of Personal Independence Payment. - Taking further action on fraud and error, saving \u00a31.3 billion in 2030-31. The welfare system is also"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "failing children. The government is therefore scrapping the two child limit in Universal Credit (UC) to lift 450,000 children out of poverty. Growing up in poverty means that an individual is more likely to end up out of education, employment or training, with children growing up in poorer households earning around 25% less at age 30 than their peers. Poverty not only damages individual futures but the long-term health of the economy. Lifting the two child limit is the quickest and most cost-effective way to reduce child poverty over this Parliament. This measure is funded by policies in this Budget, including reforming Motability tax reliefs and clamping down on fraud and error in the tax and benefits systems, including by increasing the number of face to face health assessments. ## 1.2 Protecting and strengthening the NHS and other public services while ensuring public money is well spent The government has prioritised improving public services, including investing an additional \u00a350 billion in 2029-30 relative to the Spring Budget 2024 plans, and continue to invest an additional \u00a3120 billion in capital expenditure, consistent with the fiscal framework set at Autumn Budget 2024. As a result, the government is maintaining public investment at the highest sustained level in four decades at the Budget. Every penny of public money must be spent wisely, and the state must play its part by becoming more productive. So, at this Budget, the government is introducing an additional efficiency and savings target for all departments to meet at the next spending review, resulting in \u00a32.9 billion of savings in 2028-29, rising to \u00a34.9 billion by 2030-31. These efficiencies and savings include: - Cutting the cost of politics: Abolishing Police and Crime Commissioners and reducing councillor numbers by around 5,000, saving over \u00a3250 million over five years. - Reclaiming \u00a374 million from asylum accommodation suppliers; and the government has delivered nearly \u00a3400 million of Covid fraud benefits to-date and will relentlessly pursue more cases through the new Public Sector Fraud Enforcement Unit. - Further action to close the tax gap by pursuing those who try to bend or break the rules, collecting more unpaid taxes and modernising the tax system. This brings the total additional revenue raised by closing the tax gap this Parliament to \u00a310 billion in 2029-30. ## 1.3 Making the tax system fairer and fit for the 21st century The government is making the tax system fairer and fit for the 21st century. Everyone is being asked to contribute, but the government is keeping that contribution as low as possible by pursuing fair reforms that are long overdue. Contribution: The government is maintaining personal tax thresholds and the National Insurance contributions (NICs) secondary threshold from 2028 until 2031 and the Plan 2 student loan repayment threshold from 2027-28 until 2029-30. Fairness: One reason employees pay more tax is because Britain has not historically done enough to make sure assets - and income from assets contribute fairly. Building on last year's changes to Capital Gains Tax, inheritance"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "tax, VAT on private school fees and reform of the non-domicile regime, this Budget continues to sustainably raise further revenue from sources of wealth: - The government is raising taxes on property, dividend and savings income, reflecting the fact that income from those sources faces no equivalent of National Insurance that employees pay. Existing allowances will continue to protect those with low to middle amounts of such income. - The average Band D family home pays more in Council Tax than a \u00a310 million property in Westminster, so this government is introducing a High Value Council Tax Surcharge on homes worth over \u00a32 million. Some tax reliefs that disproportionately benefit the wealthy and higher earners have significantly risen in cost in recent years. The government is therefore reforming them: - By capping NICs relief on salary sacrifice into pension schemes to the first \u00a32,000 of pension contributions per person from 2029. The costs of this relief were set to increase from \u00a32.8 billion in 2016-17 to \u00a38 billion by 2030-31 without reform, and use of these arrangements has disproportionately benefitted higher earners. The cap shields 74% of basic rate taxpayers using salary sacrifice, and the government continues to support pension saving through auto-enrolment and tax relief, worth over \u00a370 billion per year. - The government is restricting Employee Ownership Trust Capital Gains Tax relief from 100% to 50%. This is because this scheme is on course to cost \u00a32 billion, 20 times beyond the original costings when the scheme was announced in 2013. Modernisation: The government is making the tax system fit for the 21st century: - All cars contribute to wear and tear on the roads, so it is only right that motoring taxes cover electric cars via a modest self-reported per-mile levy. - Raising taxes on online gambling - which has grown substantially over the years, alongside gambling harms - while protecting face-to-face gambling, from bingo halls to horse racing. - Preventing ride-sharing taxi apps from exploiting an administrative scheme intended for tour operators in order to pay a lower rate of VAT than others. - With the rapid rise in cross-border e-commerce, some online retailers are being placed at an unfair advantage due to the UK's customs duty relief for low-value imports. This Budget is removing that relief to support Britain's businesses and high streets. ## 1.4 Taking decisive action to cut the cost of living and bring down inflation Families across the UK are feeling the squeeze of still too high inflation. The Budget delivers a set of measures to remove around \u00a3150 of costs on average from household energy bills from April next year. Energy costs will be reduced by the ending of the Energy Company Obligation, which is currently funded through bills, and through the government funding 75% of the domestic cost of the legacy Renewables Obligation for three years. This is on top of extending the \u00a3150 Warm Home Discount to a further 3 million of the poorest households. And the Budget goes"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "further by: - Introducing a one-year freeze of regulated rail fares - for the first time in 30 years - saving commuters on the more expensive routes more than \u00a3300 per year. - Implementing a one-year freeze on prescription charges, keeping fees at \u00a39.90 for a single charge. - Extending the 5p fuel duty cut until the end of August 2026 with rates then gradually returning to March 2022 levels by March 2027. The planned increase in line with inflation for 2026-27 will also be cancelled. Alongside the - introduction of Fuel Finder, these measures are expected to save families \u00a389 next year compared to previous plans. - Increasing the National Living Wage for the lowest paid to \u00a312.71 per hour in April 2026. - Supporting the incomes of over 12 million pensioners through a commitment to the Triple Lock for the duration of this parliament. In April 2026, the State Pension will be uprated by 4.8%, so pensioners will receive up to an additional \u00a3575 a year. The Budget package directly cuts inflation by 0.4 percentage points next year. This is the biggest near-term reduction in inflation due to government policy ever forecast by the OBR at a single fiscal event, outside of a crisis. This Budget takes fair and necessary choices - but those choices are for a purpose: building a stronger, fairer country, where living standards rise, child poverty falls and public services are rebuilt in every corner of Britain. ## 2. Economic and fiscal outlook UK Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in 2025 has outperformed the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) March forecast. [footnote 1] , [footnote 2] Alongside this, living standards have risen: real household disposable income (RHDI) has increased after having fallen during the previous Parliament; real wages rose more in the past 16 months than they did between 2010 and 2020. [footnote 3] , [footnote 4] GDP per capita has grown by 1.0% since the start of the Parliament (Q2 2024). [footnote 5] This compares to a decline of 0.2% across the previous Parliament. [footnote 6] Despite this stronger performance, the UK faces longstanding economic challenges. Productivity growth has been persistently weak, caused by historic under-investment and a series of economic shocks. The OBR has revised down its forecast for underlying medium-term productivity growth after it has consistently undershot its forecast. On its own, the lower forecast for productivity growth would have lowered revenues by around \u00a316 billion in 2029-30. [footnote 7] The government has set out an economic and fiscal plan underpinned by the principles of stability, investment and reform that will enable the conditions for sustainable growth and reduce the cost of living. The Budget continues to deliver on this strategy. The government is meeting the non-negotiable fiscal rules, more than doubling the buffer to the stability rule to \u00a321.7 billion and is cutting debt: net financial debt (public sector net financial liabilities) is forecast to fall as a share of GDP in 2029-30 and 2030-31, and is lower by the"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "end of the forecast than in 2025-26. From 2025 to 2030, the UK is reducing government borrowing more than any other G7 country. [footnote 8] To support the economy with greater policy certainty, the government is delivering on its commitment to hold one fiscal event a year, by legislating to ensure that the fiscal rules are only assessed at future Budgets. At the same time, the government is continuing to drive sustainably higher growth and is tackling the cost of living. The Budget has protected an increase of over \u00a3120 billion in departmental capital spending, compared with previous plans, and taken measures that are expected to reduce Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation by 0.4 percentage points in 2026-27. [footnote 9] This is the biggest nearterm reduction in inflation due to government policy ever forecast by the OBR at a single fiscal event, outside of a crisis. [footnote 10] ## 2.1 Economic and fiscal context ## Economic context UK GDP has grown by 1.0% in 2025 to date with strong growth in Q1 as firms and households brought forward activity, whilst recent growth has been slower. Household consumption grew for the fifth consecutive quarter, rising by 0.2% in Q3, and across 2025 business investment has grown by 2.7% in real terms, outperforming the OBR's March forecast. Growth in 2025 has been primarily driven by services output, which in Q3 was 1.6% higher compared with the same quarter a year ago. [footnote 11] CPI inflation peaked at over 11% in October 2022, following global supply chain disruption and a sharp rise in energy prices caused by Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine. [footnote 12] High inflation has weighed on living standards and pushed up government borrowing costs. CPI inflation rose through the second half of 2024 and first half of 2025, in part due to past large falls in the energy price cap dropping out of the annual comparison, one-off price rises, and higher food price inflation. Inflation has now started to fall, coming down to 3.6% in October from 3.8% in September (Chart 1.1). ## Chart 1.1: Contribution to Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation Source: Office for National Statistics. Hiring has continued to ease through 2025. Demand for labour has softened, with vacancies falling 99,000 in the year to October. [footnote 13] The number of payrolled employees is down over the same period, with the fall due to lower inflows as opposed to higher outflows. [footnote 14] With slower hiring, unemployment has risen to 5.0% in Q3 2025. [footnote 15] The rise in unemployment has been concentrated among young people, with the youth (1624 year olds) unemployment rate standing at 15.3% in the same period. [footnote 16] The rate of young people not in education, employment, or training (NEET) has risen over the last six years and is now 12.7% in Q3 2025, up 1.2 percentage points from the same period in 2019. [footnote 17] , [footnote 18] Against this backdrop, nominal pay growth has eased, with private sector regular pay growth"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "falling to 4.2% in Q3. [footnote 19] In real terms, wages have continued to rise and have now been increasing for over two years. [footnote 20] The global macroeconomic environment remains volatile and uncertain. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects global growth to slow slightly from 3.3% in 2024 to 3.2% in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026 - cumulatively 0.2 percentage points below its October 2024 projections. [footnote 21] Trade policy uncertainty remains elevated despite falling from its April 2025 peak, deterring business investment and dampening growth. The UK faces risks from geopolitical tensions, including Russia's illegal war in Ukraine, global trade disruption, and increasing global fiscal pressures. The OBR notes 'significant uncertainty' around global trade policy developments as a risk to the UK's economic outlook. Despite some volatility in April, global and UK equities have risen over 2025 in line with generally positive risk sentiment. [footnote 22] ## Structural trends Weak productivity growth has dragged on living standards over the past 15 years. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, between 2010 and 2019, annual productivity growth averaged 0.6%, down by around 1.5 percentage points from the decade prior to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) (1998-2007) (Chart 1.2). [footnote 23] If productivity growth had continued at the pre-GFC rate, then GDP per capita could have been around \u00a315,000 higher in 2024. [footnote 24] Instead, productivity growth slowed significantly. Whilst this slowdown has also been experienced by G7 peers - annual productivity growth in France, Germany and the US slowed from 1.6%, 1.4% and 2.3% in the decade prior to the GFC, to 0.9%, 1.2% and 0.9% in the decade after, respectively - the UK saw the largest fall between these periods. [footnote 25] Since the pandemic, the US has seen a partial recovery in its productivity growth, demonstrating the ability of advanced economies' productivity growth to pick up. ## Chart 1.2: Pre-GFC trend and outturn productivity growth Source: HMT Calculations and Office for National Statistics. In the UK, the decline in trend productivity growth following the GFC has been largely driven by under-investment, compounded by a series of economic shocks including recent trade disruption, the effect of Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine on energy prices, the COVID-19 pandemic and leaving the EU. [footnote 26] Tackling under-investment is key to sustainably raising growth and living standards. Recent data has shown positive signs; whole-economy investment has risen by 4.2% in real terms since the start of the year, outperforming the OBR's March forecast for a decline of 0.1%. [footnote 27] Over the same period, business investment has increased by 2.7%, above the OBR's March forecast for growth of 1.1%. [footnote 28] ## Box 1.A: Changes to the OBR's productivity forecast The OBR has revised down its forecast for medium-term productivity growth, measured as output per hour, by 0.3 percentage points to 1.0% at the end of the OBR's five-year forecast period. This revision has brought the OBR's productivity forecast in line with the Bank of England's forecast and those of other external forecasters."}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "[footnote 29] The UK's productivity challenge is a longstanding one. The OBR has stated the revision was 'not prompted by any particular government policy decisions' and was based on an assessment of the persistence of the UK's slowdown since the GFC. The OBR expects that productivity growth will be lower than it previously assumed, but still higher than average productivity growth in the post-GFC period. The outlook for productivity affects living standards and the public finances. The revision to productivity growth in isolation has lowered tax revenues by around \u00a316 billion in 2029-30 compared to the OBR's March 2025 forecast. The government is already taking ambitious action to boost growth: protecting over \u00a3120 billion additional departmental capital spending over the Parliament, compared to previous plans; reforming the planning system to unlock building; and implementing the 10-year Infrastructure Strategy and Industrial Strategy. [footnote 30] The government is strengthening ties and resetting the relationship with the EU, and has secured trade deals with India and the US. Most recently productivity growth has started to pick up. In the year to Q3 2025, productivity growth was 1.1%, up from -0.6% in the year to Q2 2024. Estimates of productivity incorporating Pay As You Earn Real Time Information suggest that, in the year to Q3 2025, productivity growth was 3.1%, up from -1.1% in the year to Q2 2024 - its fastest rate, outside the pandemic, in the last decade. [footnote 31] ## Fiscal context Net financial debt as a share of GDP remains close to its highest recorded level, reached in the COVID-19 pandemic. [footnote 32] Public sector net borrowing (PSNB) has remained elevated at around 5% of GDP since the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in borrowing of around \u00a3150 billion in 2024-25. [footnote 33] UK borrowing as a share of GDP is the third highest in the G7. [footnote 34] If borrowing remained elevated at 5% of GDP across the forecast, this would mean a cumulatively \u00a322.1 billion higher debt interest bill than the OBR's forecast. [footnote 35] The government's fiscal strategy is to reduce borrowing and debt, to avoid spending ever more taxpayer money on debt interest. Debt servicing costs were over \u00a3100 billion in 2023-24 and 2024-25. [footnote 36] \u00a31 in every \u00a310 of public sector spending goes on servicing previously borrowed money, instead of supporting public services or investment. [footnote 37] This is roughly equivalent to four times the amount currently spent on nurses employed in the hospital and community health sector. [footnote 38] The UK has the highest borrowing costs of any G7 country. If UK yields were instead at the average of those of G7 peers, debt interest costs would be \u00a360 billion lower across the forecast horizon. [footnote 39] ## 2.2 Macroeconomic and fiscal strategy Economic growth is the central mission of the government. The government is making responsible choices to strengthen the foundations of the UK's economy in order to raise living standards, underpinned by the principles of stability, investment and reform. Stability consists of low"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "and stable inflation, sustainable public finances and predictable and consistent policy decisions. ## Securing stability Low and stable inflation reduces uncertainty for consumers and businesses, supporting them to make long-term planning and investment decisions and providing the confidence to increase consumption. The independent Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England is responsible for bringing inflation to target. The government has published the remit for the MPC alongside the Budget to reaffirm that the Bank of England's price stability objective is defined as 2% CPI inflation, which applies at all times. In addition, the government is taking action to bear down on prices to support households with the cost of living, with measures on energy bills, transport costs and fuel duty. Taken together, the OBR's forecast shows government policy will reduce CPI inflation by 0.4 percentage points in 2026-27, supporting the Bank of England to get inflation back to target (Chart 1.3). ## Chart 1.3: Effect of policy measures on annual CPI inflation Sound public finances underpin macroeconomic stability. The OBR forecast shows the government is reducing borrowing as a share of GDP in every year of the forecast to support sustainable growth, low inflation and low interest rates. The Bank of England has cut Bank Rate five times this Parliament, which has translated to a saving of \u00a31,200 a year for someone taking out a representative new two-year fixed rate mortgage in September 2025 compared to June 2024. [footnote 40] ## Box 1.B: Fiscal stance Fiscal policy influences growth and inflation by adding or withdrawing demand from the economy. The fiscal stance, measured by the primary deficit, assesses the effect of taxation and public sector expenditure on the economy by removing interest costs from borrowing as they are not a meaningful indicator of how fiscal policy affects the economy. The primary deficit is forecast to fall by 0.7% of GDP in the current financial year, the first material reduction since the withdrawal of COVID-19 pandemic support. The primary deficit falls by 1.4 percentage points between 2025-26 and 2027-28, and moves into surplus, which would be the first primary surplus since 2001 -02. [footnote 41] By 2030-31, the OBR forecasts a 1.4% of GDP primary surplus, driven by both higher tax revenue - accounting for around two thirds of the consolidation - and lower spending - accounting for the remainder. [footnote 42] The UK is set to consolidate more than any other G7 country from 2025 to 2030. [footnote 43] This consistent, steady reduction in the primary deficit is the most effective way for fiscal policy to reduce inflationary pressures, supporting the actions of the MPC to return inflation sustainably to target. The cyclically-adjusted primary deficit (CAPD) controls for the impact of the economic cycle and is a widely accepted measure of discretionary fiscal support. Across the forecast, the CAPD is expected to fall consistently and remains at a lower level than the primary deficit until 2028-29. This reflects the government taking the necessary decisions to bring the deficit"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "down, at a pace that is well matched to the strength of activity and allowing monetary policy to adjust. Chart 1.4: Fiscal stance Source: Office for National Statistics and Office for Budget Responsibility. The government is meeting its non-negotiable fiscal rules. At the Budget, the fiscal rules target the fourth year of the forecast. Gradually bringing the time horizon for the fiscal rules forward improves on previous fiscal rules which targeted the fifth rolling year of the forecast and enabled continual delays to fiscal consolidation. To further support stability and certainty for businesses and households, the Budget is going further to increase the buffer against these rules, in line with IMF recommendations. [footnote 44] Action taken at the Budget means that the public finances are protected by a larger buffer of \u00a321.7 billion against the stability rule. This buffer is greater than the average revision to the OBR's forecast between fiscal events in the fourth year, helping to protect tax and spending plans from changes in the economy. The Budget is strengthening the fiscal framework to deliver on the government's commitment to hold one major fiscal event per year, supporting the economy with greater policy certainty. Responding to recommendations made by the IMF, the government will legislate to ensure the OBR assesses performance against the fiscal rules once a year at the Budget. [footnote 45] The OBR will continue to publish a second five-year forecast in the spring, providing an interim update on the economy and public finances, and to inform the Debt Management Office's (DMO) financing remit. The government will not normally respond with fiscal policy, unless there is a significant change to the economic outlook that requires a response. To ensure the public finances are more resilient to economic shocks, the government is setting out a strategy at the Budget for managing its implicit liabilities. [footnote 46] Implicit liabilities are private sector liabilities which government may be compelled to meet during crisis events. This strategy is a proactive approach to managing implicit liabilities, providing a toolkit to mitigate costs. This is supported by a \u00a315 million fund, which will be allocated to priority projects to develop and implement policy options for mitigation, including pursuing legislative or regulatory changes where appropriate. ## Responsible decisions for the future The government is building a stronger economy both now and for future generations, improving living standards across all regions of the UK. The government is tackling historic under-investment to boost productivity and driving reforms to raise growth. ## Going for growth At Autumn Budget 2024, the government set fiscal rules which supported a necessary step change in investment by delivering over \u00a3120 billion of increased departmental capital spending, compared to previous plans. At Budget 2025 the government is protecting this investment. Tackling historic under-investment is critical to boosting productivity. Higher public investment increases the stock of capital in the economy, which in turn increases the level of capital per worker, productivity and potential output. Broadening the target measure of debt recognises that"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "financial investments, such as those made by the National Wealth Fund, create value for the taxpayer as well as supporting growth. The government has provided its public financial institutions with \u00a3153 billion of capacity, including through the National Wealth Fund, which has deployed \u00a33.8 billion in its first year and is expected to catalyse over \u00a370 billion of private investment in high-growth sectors at the heart of the government's industrial strategy. [footnote 47] The OBR has set out that policies announced by the government will increase the potential output of the UK economy. Decisions taken across this Parliament, including planning reform, planned increases in public investment, and trade deals struck with other countries, will raise output in the medium and longer term (Chart 1.5). The OBR estimates that the combined supply-side effects of policy announced across the Parliament will raise the level of GDP by over 0.6% after 10 years. [footnote 48] At Spring Statement 2025, the government also increased departmental capital budgets by a further \u00a313 billion across the forecast period. [footnote 49] These benefits will continue to build after 2035; the OBR estimated that public investment will raise the level of GDP by 1.4% in the long run (over 50 years). Public investment could further crowd in additional private sector investment where additional public sector investment raises returns in the private sector and labour market. ## Chart 1.5: OBR-estimated supply side effects of policies announced this Parliament Source: Office for Budget Responsibility figures and HM Treasury calculations. ## Fiscal sustainability Alongside the Budget, the government is publishing a response to the OBR's 2025 Fiscal risks and sustainability report, which sets out how the government is addressing long-term sustainability challenges. [footnote 50] The fiscal strategy to reduce borrowing will improve the sustainability of the public finances for future generations, as every additional \u00a31 billion the government borrows to spend today means \u00a3150 million more spent on debt interest each year in 30 years' time. [footnote 51] The government is taking responsible decisions to reform the tax system in order to support long-term fiscal sustainability. Decisions taken at the Budget help to strengthen the tax base, including: introducing eVED to respond to the long-term decline in fuel duty receipts as more people choose to switch to cleaner, greener electric cars; ensuring income from assets is taxed fairly by increasing taxes on property, dividends and savings to help to close the gap between tax paid on work and tax paid on income from assets; reforming existing tax reliefs such as changes to salary sacrifice arrangements for pension contributions; and introducing a new High Value Council Tax Surcharge. The government is taking action to improve the sustainability of public spending, including by: launching the third independent review of State Pension age and a new Pensions Commission to help build a strong, fair and sustainable pension system that is fit for the future; publishing the 10 Year Health Plan, which will help secure the financial sustainability of the NHS; reforming administration of the"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "welfare system to reduce fraud and error, which will save \u00a34.6 billion in 203031, due to actions at the Budget and the previous two fiscal events. [footnote 52] , [footnote 53] , [footnote 54] The government will also set out substantial plans for reform of special educational needs provision to deliver a sustainable system which - first and foremost - supports children and families effectively, through a Schools White Paper early in the new year. To further improve its management of the public sector balance sheet, the government has announced a Strategic Asset Review in support of a \u00a31 billion asset efficiency target, and a value-for-money review of the maintenance of public sector assets, which will be conducted ahead of the next spending review in 2027. These programmes are the first applications of the new Balance Sheet Framework published at the Budget, which for the first time sets out a comprehensive approach to the management of public sector assets, liabilities and entities. [footnote 55] It will guide decisions on new transactions, use of private finance and disposal of assets, alongside ensuring existing assets are well managed. ## 2.3 Economic and fiscal outlook ## Economic outlook The government's decisions in Budget 2025 will lower inflation, protect investment and provide greater stability, which will support the growth mission.

Source: Office for Budget Responsibility and Office for National Statistics. The OBR forecasts the economy will grow by 1.5% in 2025, revised up from 1.0% in its March forecast. GDP growth is then forecast to slow slightly to 1.4% in 2026, before returning to 1.5% in subsequent years. Average GDP growth across 2026 to 2029 is now expected to be 1.5% compared with 1.6% in the OBR's March forecast. The OBR expects the level of real GDP at the end of its forecast horizon to be broadly in line with its March forecast. This is because of upward revisions to the level of GDP in Blue Book 2025, and stronger-thanexpected growth in 2025. [footnote 56] The key driver of lower real GDP growth over the forecast is the downgrade to medium-term productivity growth (Table 1.1). [footnote 57] The OBR expects total employment to increase from 34.2 million in 2025 to 35.4 million in 2030 - higher in every year of the forecast than previously expected. The OBR forecasts the unemployment rate to peak at 5% in the first half of 2026, before falling to 4.1% by the end of the forecast period. The OBR expects inflation to have peaked in Q3 2025, and that it will fall progressively to the Bank of England's 2% target in Q1 2027. Actions taken by the government at the Budget will reduce inflation by a peak quarterly impact of 0.5 percentage points in Q2 2026 and 0.3 percentage points in 2026 on average. The OBR has increased its nominal GDP growth forecast over 2025 and 2026 but reduced its forecast for later years. The OBR expects the level of nominal GDP at the end of the forecast to be higher than March, due to the Blue Book 2025 revisions leaving the level of nominal GDP 1.4% higher in Q2 2025."}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "Average nominal earnings growth is 0.8 percentage points higher in 2025 than in the OBR's March forecast. The average nominal earnings growth forecast has also been revised up across 2026 and 2027, by 1.0 percentage point and 0.2 percentage points, respectively. Relative to the previous forecast, the OBR judges that the composition of nominal GDP growth will change towards labour income, with cumulative growth in labour income forecast to be 0.8 percentage points higher, and growth in corporate profits 6.5 percentage points lower, over the same period. The OBR forecasts that RHDI per capita and GDP per capita will rise by 2.9% and 5.3% respectively over this Parliament (Q3 2024 - Q2 2029). This would more than reverse the 1.8% fall in RHDI per capita seen in the previous Parliament. [footnote 58] ## Fiscal outlook Lower forecast productivity growth than at previous fiscal events has weakened the public finances by reducing forecast tax receipts. The OBR highlights that receipts are around \u00a316 billion lower in 2029-30 than they would have been if productivity growth had remained the same as in the OBR's March forecast (Table 1.2). At the same time, higher inflation, stronger wage growth and changes to the composition of GDP have increased receipts, whilst the OBR has revised up its forecast for local government net borrowing, and spending on welfare benefits and debt interest.

The Budget takes decisive action to secure the public finances whilst protecting the investment needed to drive growth in the medium term. PSNB as a share of GDP in 2025-26 is set to be the lowest for six years. [footnote 59] Borrowing is falling in every year of the forecast, from 4.5% of GDP in 2025-26 to 1.9% in 2030-31 (Table 1.3). The greatest fall in borrowing occurs in the first full year of the OBR's forecast - PSNB is 1% lower in 2026-27 than in 2025-26. In 202930, borrowing is lower compared to the OBR's March forecast.

The OBR forecasts that the current budget will move into surplus in 2028-29, meeting the stability rule a year early (Chart 1.7). The current budget surplus reaches \u00a321.7 billion in 2029-30, which would be the largest current budget surplus for over 20 years, more than doubling the buffer to the stability rule. [footnote 60] Net financial debt falls as a share of GDP in 2029-30 and in 2030-31, meeting the investment rule in 2029-30 by a margin of \u00a324.4 billion. Net financial debt is forecast to be lower as a share of GDP in 2030-31 than in 2025-26. The OBR assesses that the welfare cap will be met by \u00a31.9 billion in 2029 -30. ## Financing The DMO net financing requirement for 2025-26 is forecast to be \u00a3314.7 billion. The remit for the DMO has been updated to reflect this, increasing by \u00a35.6 billion. This will be financed through \u00a3303.7 billion of gilt sales (an increase of \u00a34.6 billion), as well as \u00a311 billion from the sale of Treasury bills used for debt management purposes (an increase of \u00a31 billion). The net financing target of National Savings and Investments is also increased by \u00a31 billion to \u00a313 billion in 2025-26, within a range of plus or minus \u00a34 billion. The government's financing plans for 2025-26 are summarised in Annex A. The Central Government Net Cash Requirement (CGNCR) is \u00a3149.2 billion in 2025-26; the increase in CGNCR since the OBR's March forecast is \u00a314.1 billion lower than the increase in PSNB in 2025-26 and \u00a310.7 billion lower than the increase in PSNB in 2026-27. [footnote 61] This is driven by several forecast changes which are neutral for or increase PSNB, but decrease or do not significantly impact CGNCR. This includes the Asset Purchase Facility (APF) indemnity payment from HM Treasury to the Bank of England, local authority net borrowing, and inflation-driven debt interest costs from index-linked gilts. The government is committed to maintaining as diversified an investor base as possible to enhance the resilience of the government's financing programme. In keeping with this, HMT and the DMO will launch a consultation in January 2026 on expanding and deepening the Treasury bill market. In accordance with the debt management objective, any changes following the consultation will take into account an assessment of cost and risk, including implications for the government's refinancing risk exposure. At end-September 2025, the average maturity of the total stock of debt was 13.7 years. [footnote 62] Year-to-year changes in the composition of issuance generally have a marginal impact on the average maturity of the debt stock, given the relative size of annual issuance compared with the stock. The average maturity remains consistently longer than the average"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "across the G7. [footnote 63] The government has at the Budget published an updated Green Financing Framework, adding nuclear energy to the list of eligible expenditures for green financing (with some exclusions). [footnote 64] This reinforces the government's firm conviction that nuclear energy is green and is a crucial part of making Britain a green energy superpower. The proceeds from sales of green gilts and Green Savings Bonds issued prior to 27 November 2025 will not be allocated to nuclear energy-related expenditures. A Second Party Opinion from S&amp;P rates the new Framework as dark green, their highest rating, and an improvement on the Framework's original rating in 2021. ## Balance sheet In addition to its fiscal rules, the government has committed to consider a wide range of metrics to inform a full assessment of the sustainability of the public finances and will seek to improve sustainability over time (Chart 1.7). [footnote 65] PSND as a share of GDP is forecast to peak in 2028-29 at 97.0% and then falls in 2029-30 and 2030-31, reaching 96.1% by the end of the forecast. Public sector net worth (PSNW) is expected to strengthen from -70.3% of GDP in 202829 to -69.5% in 2029 -30 and -68.0% in 2030-31. By the end of the forecast, the level of PSNW improves by over 2 percentage points compared to the 2025-26 level. ## Chart 1.7: Four measures of the public sector balance sheet ## 1 Government Finance Statistics Manual.

Best practice in fiscal transparency means reporting on obligations that taxpayers may have to meet in the future, due to decisions today. Contingent liabilities are not included in net financial debt because they represent potential, rather than actual, obligations, often only being recognised at the point of crystallisation. The significant contingent liabilities that government has entered into since Spring Statement 2025 are set out in Table 1.4.

Strong foundations ## 3.1 Cost of living The government is committed to improving living standards for everyone, in every part of the UK. The best headline measure of progress in living standards is real household disposable income (RHDI) per capita, which fell by 1.8% in the last Parliament, making it the only Parliament since records began in the 1950s in which living standards fell. [footnote 67] This fall has already been reversed; RHDI per capita was \u00a3800 higher in the first year of this Parliament, compared with the final year of the previous Parliament. [footnote 68] The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts growth to continue, with RHDI per capita projected to grow by 2.9% over this Parliament. [footnote 69] However, persistently high inflation has weighed on living standards. The government's strategy for improving living standards is through growing the economy, which is the only way to sustainably increase wages, and through tackling inflation. ## Bearing down on prices High inflation erodes living standards and deters business investment. [footnote 70] Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation has been considerably lower than it was in 2022 when it breached 11%. [footnote 71] Nonetheless, it has remained elevated, with people across the UK feeling the squeeze. CPI inflation rose through the second half of 2024 and first half of 2025, in part due to past large falls in the energy price cap dropping out of the annual comparison, one-off price rises, and higher food price inflation. Inflation has now started to fall, coming down to 3.6% in October from 3.8% in September. In everyday terms, food prices increased over 25% between the start of 2022 and May 2024, with the UK experiencing nearly 15 years of typical food inflation"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "during that period. [footnote 72] , [footnote 73] The Bank of England has overall responsibility for controlling inflation and expects inflation to fall to the 2% target. [footnote 74] The government is fully committed to tackling high inflation alongside the Bank through responsible fiscal strategy. Government policy at the Budget stabilises the public finances, strengthens the foundations for economic prosperity and boosts growth. Beyond this, the government is targeting inflation at its source, by bearing down on everyday expenses such as energy bills, transport and childcare costs to ease cost of living pressures. Taken together, the OBR's forecast shows government policy will reduce CPI inflation by 0.4 percentage points next year. [footnote 75] This is the biggest near-term reduction in inflation due to government policy ever forecast by the OBR at a single fiscal event, outside of a crisis. [footnote 76] The government recognises the strain that high energy prices have placed on people, including the spike in wholesale gas prices after Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine. The Budget is delivering a package of measures to remove around \u00a3150 of costs on average from household energy bills across Great Britain from April 2026. [footnote 77] This will be delivered through the government funding 75% of the domestic cost of the legacy Renewables Obligation for the rest of this spending review period from 2026-27 to 2028-29 and ending the Energy Company Obligation which is currently funded through energy bills. These measures are forecast to directly reduce inflation by over 0.2 percentage points in 2026-27. [footnote 78] On top of reducing energy bills at the Budget, the government has also expanded the Warm Home Discount, which means that in total six million households will receive \u00a3150 off their energy bills this winter. [footnote 79] As well as taking costs off household energy bills, the government will provide an additional \u00a31.5 billion capital investment to tackle fuel poverty through the Warm Homes Plan, in addition to the \u00a313.2 billion of funding allocated at Spending Review 2025. The government is committed to doing more to reduce electricity costs for all households and improve the price of electricity relative to gas. The government will consider how to further target the savings announced in the Budget at electricity bills, including the savings derived from ending the Energy Company Obligation scheme. The government will set out how it intends to deliver this through the Warm Homes Plan. The government is focused on bringing down energy bills for households and businesses, while securing the necessary infrastructure investment to build a resilient energy system and reduce the UK's dependence on imported fossil fuels. The government will subject any additional costs, including new levies, to enhanced scrutiny under a new framework to ensure they are affordable, represent value for money and do not impose unnecessary costs on households and businesses. Transport costs represent 14% of household spending. [footnote 80] To bear down on the cost of travelling by rail, the government is freezing all regulated rail fares in England for"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "one year starting from March 2026, saving the average passenger \u00a3300 per year on the most expensive routes. [footnote 81] This is the first time the government has frozen regulated rail fares for a year in 30 years and means passengers will not see any changes to the price of season tickets, peak return fares for commuters and off-peak returns between major cities until March 2027. This builds on the government's previous decision to extend the \u00a33 bus cap to March 2027, covering 5,000 bus routes. [footnote 82] Pump prices are at their lowest levels since 2021, before Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine led to soaring prices and the introduction of a temporary 5p cut in fuel duty. [footnote 83] The government is extending the 5p fuel duty cut until the end of August 2026, with rates then gradually returning to March 2022 levels by March 2027. The planned increase in line with inflation for 2026-27 will also be cancelled. From Spring 2026, UK consumers will also be able to compare prices more easily through the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero's open data Fuel Finder scheme, encouraging competitive pricing among retailers, with analysis suggesting households who own a car could save an average of around \u00a340 a year. [footnote 84] Together, the actions the government is taking on fuel prices is set to save households with a car \u00a389 next year compared with previous plans. [footnote 85] The Budget ensures that people can continue to access the medicines they need. That is why millions of people in England will see the cost of their prescriptions frozen for a year from April 2026, including keeping the single charge at \u00a39.90, which will save patients on aggregate around \u00a312 million. [footnote 86] The government has also announced that all women will be able to access the morning-after pill free of charge in pharmacies across England. This eliminates the postcode lottery of access to emergency contraception, so everyone can access the care they deserve. Although food price inflation has decreased, it is still too high at 4.9%. [footnote 87] Households are feeling the impact of this in their weekly shop, with those on lower incomes suffering the most. The government is acting decisively, negotiating an agri-food deal with the EU to make it easier for the UK to trade with its biggest partner. [footnote 88] Food businesses will save time and up to \u00a3200 per shipment when trading fresh food, helping to reduce pressure on prices. [footnote 89] The government also recently announced a Food Inflation Gateway to assess and monitor regulation which could add to food prices. [footnote 90] This will enable the government to coordinate and sequence changes and give food businesses a single line of sight so they can keep prices as low as possible. Resolving the historic under-investment in water infrastructure across England and Wales has led to bill increases over the past 12 months.

These reforms will deliver better value for money and keep long-term costs down for customers. The government and Ofwat are also requiring water companies to improve support for customers, including doubling compensation when minimum standards are not met, and reforming the Water Sure scheme to better support low-income households with high water needs. Whilst private rental price inflation has fallen to 5.0% in October 2025 from a peak of 9.1% in March 2024, the government is committed to making renting easier and more affordable for 11 million private renters in England. [footnote 92] The Renters' Rights Act 2025 will empower tenants to challenge unreasonable rent increases by ensuring tenants are able to appeal excessive above-market rents which are purely designed to force them out. It will also abolish 'Section 21' evictions, giving renters greater security and stability. Well-functioning, competitive markets deliver lower prices for consumers and support growth. The government has asked the independent Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to conduct a study of private provision in the dentistry market. The government is also following up on recent work by the CMA, including by: - Consulting later this year on a new regulatory framework for the veterinary market to increase competition for business and transparency for pet owners, providing more choice and bringing down costs. - Introducing a price cap prohibiting the resale of a live events ticket for more than its original cost. Inclusive of all fees paid, the average ticket price paid by fans on the resale market could reduce by \u00a337 in the UK. [footnote 93] - Consulting to ensure families living on privately managed estates in England can hold their estate managers to account for costs they pay to maintain public amenities such as roads, play areas and open spaces, and consulting on reducing the prevalence of these privately managed estates in future. The government is also committed to protecting consumers, so they are treated fairly, including in the telecoms sector, where the Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology are working alongside Ofcom to ensure customers get a fair deal and are able to switch provider easily.

The government is therefore taking action to combat child poverty by removing the two child limit on the Child Element in Universal Credit (UC). ## Box 2.A: Removing the two child limit in Universal Credit The removal of the two child limit will lift 450,000 children out of poverty, rising to around 550,000 alongside other measures announced this year, such as the expansion of free school meals. [footnote 94] , [footnote 95] These interventions will lead to the largest expected reduction in child poverty over ## Household saving a Parliament since comparable records began. [footnote 96] Poverty imposes significant economic and societal costs. The Child Poverty Action Group estimates the cost to the country at \u00a340 billion per year. [footnote 97] Growing up in poverty means that an individual is more likely to end up out of education, employment or training, with children growing up in poorer households earning around 25% less at age 30 than their peers. [footnote 98] This measure is funded by policies in the Budget, including reforming Motability's tax reliefs, clamping down on fraud and error in the tax and benefits systems, and by increasing the number of face to face health assessments. It will help break the cycle of disadvantage and improve life chances for children nationwide. This measure will support low-income families across the UK. 95,000 children in Scotland and 69,000 in Wales will benefit from this change. [footnote 99] The government is also funding the Northern Ireland Executive to remove the two child limit should they choose to do so. To further support families with children, the government is expanding free breakfast clubs by launching the first phase of national rollout with 2,000 new schools joining the scheme over 2026-27, and expanding free school meals eligibility to all pupils in England with a parent receiving UC, lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. [footnote 100] In addition, the government is introducing new legislation that limits the number of branded items schools can require, to lower the costs of school uniforms. The government will also support working families with three or more children by increasing the maximum amount of childcare costs they can claim in UC. The government is expanding the Help to Save scheme to UC claimants who receive either the caring element or the child element. This will enable more low -income households to build strong savings habits and improve their financial security. The Standard Allowance, the basic amount of UC all eligible households receive, will increase by over 6% in April 2026, in line with the UC Act 2025. Alongside reforms to the UC Health Element, this helps deliver a rebalancing of the benefit system to better incentivise work. The OBR estimates these reforms will have a positive impact on getting people into work. Other working age benefit rates covered by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions' statutory review will be increased by 3.8%, in line with"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "September 2025 CPI. The government will support the incomes of over 12 million pensioners through its commitment to the Triple Lock for the duration of this Parliament. [footnote 101] The basic and new State Pension will be increased by 4.8%, from April 2026, in line with average weekly earnings up to an additional \u00a3575 per year to pensioners, depending on their entitlement. After announcing at Autumn Budget 2024 the largest ever cash increase to the Carer's Allowance payment Weekly Earnings Limit, the government is now taking further action to support carers as recommended by the Independent Review of Carer's Allowance Overpayments, led by Liz Sayce OBE. [footnote 102] The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will reassess overpayments caused by incorrect DWP operational guidance on how to average fluctuating earnings and begin to reduce or cancel existing debts or return previously collected debts to affected carers from 2026. From 1 April 2026, the National Living Wage will increase by 4.1% to \u00a312.71 per hour for eligible workers aged 21 and over. This represents an increase of \u00a3900 to the gross annual earnings of a full-time worker on the National Living Wage. [footnote 103] Around 2.4 million low-paid workers are expected to benefit from this increase. [footnote 104] The government will continue to ensure that all eligible adults are fairly rewarded for their work - balancing the needs of workers, affordability for employers and opportunities for employment. ## Box 2.B: Impact on households The distributional analysis published alongside the Budget shows that, on average, households in the lowest income deciles in 2028-29 will benefit most from the policy decisions taken by the government from Autumn Budget 2024 onwards. Increases in tax will be concentrated among the highest income households. Increases in spending on public services, such as health and education, benefit households on lower incomes the most. On average, all but the richest 10% of households will benefit as a percentage of income from overall policy decisions in 2028-29.

See the 'Impact on Households' publication for more details on the impact of policy decisions on households across the income distribution. ## 3.2 Securing the public finances and tax reform The government is making the tax system fairer and fit for the 21st century. Everyone is being asked to contribute, but the government is keeping that contribution as low as possible by pursuing fair reforms that are long overdue. The government is asking everyone to contribute to support economic stability and protect the public services everyone uses. The government is limiting the broad-based contribution through a programme of reform to modernise the tax system, address unequal and unfair treatment, and ensure that those with the broadest shoulders contribute more. This builds on the approach taken at Autumn Budget 2024, with reforms forecast to raise over \u00a38 billion in 2029-30 from wealth and the wealthy."}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "[footnote 105] The government is pursuing fair reforms that are long overdue. This includes addressing: unfairness in how different forms of income are taxed; imbalances in the property tax system; reliefs that are costing more than intended; and the future of motoring taxes. The government is also closing loopholes and removing barriers to make sure that people pay the tax they owe. ## Asking everyone to contribute The government is asking everyone to contribute to support economic stability and protect public services. However, the government is not increasing the headline rates of income tax, National Insurance contributions (NICs) or VAT. The government will maintain income tax thresholds and the equivalent NICs thresholds for employees and self-employed individuals at their current levels for a further three years from April 2028 to April 2031, and inheritance tax thresholds for a further year to April 2031. The government is also maintaining the Secondary Threshold at its current level from April 2028 to April 2031. In 2029 -30, three -quarters of the revenue from maintaining income tax and employee and self-employed NICs thresholds is expected to come from the top half of households. To ensure the sustainability of the student loan system, the government will maintain the Plan 2 repayment threshold at its 2026-27 level for three years from April 2027. Graduates generally benefit from higher earnings, and ensuring that they repay more of their loan is fair for those workers who have not gone to university. This does not increase the level of debt for these graduates. ## Taking fair decisions on tax One reason employees pay more tax is because Britain has not historically done enough to make sure assets - and income from assets - contribute fairly. Building on last year's changes to Capital Gains Tax (CGT), inheritance tax (IHT), VAT on private school fees and reform of the non-domicile regime, the Budget continues to sustainably raise further revenue from sources of wealth. The UK has established taxes on wealth and assets that raise revenue reliably. At Autumn Budget 2024, the government raised taxes on wealth and the wealthy, forecast to raise over an additional \u00a38 billion per year by 2029-30. [footnote 106] At the start of the Parliament, CGT raised \u00a313.7 billion and IHT raised \u00a38.3 billion. [footnote 107] By the end of the forecast (2030-31), CGT is forecast to raise \u00a330 billion and IHT \u00a314.5 billion. [footnote 108] Following re-costings conducted by HMRC, and certified by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the reforms to the taxation of non-domiciled individuals implemented in April are now expected to raise \u00a339.5 billion across the scorecard, and VAT on private school fees is expected to raise an average of \u00a340 million extra per year. The government is implementing previously announced reforms to taxes on wealth and assets including: - From 6 April 2026, the CGT rate for Business Asset Disposal Relief and Investors' Relief will increase to match the main lower rate at 18%. - From 6 April 2026, the government will"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "reform agricultural property relief and business property relief. - From 6 April 2026, the government will introduce a revised tax regime for carried interest which sits wholly within the income tax framework. - From 6 April 2027, the government is removing the opportunity for individuals to use pensions as a vehicle for IHT planning by bringing unspent pots into the scope of IHT. The government is announcing further changes to ensure that these policies are implemented effectively. The \u00a31 million allowance for the 100% rate of agricultural property relief and business property relief will be transferable between spouses and civil partners. The government will also make changes to the way internationally mobile individuals are taxed, closing loopholes and capping relevant property trust charges payable by certain trusts. At the Budget, the government is making further reforms to taxation of income from assets and property wealth to make sure the wealthiest pay their fair share. The government is also taking action on tax reliefs which have grown in cost and favour individuals with higher earnings or wealth. These measures mean the government can limit the contribution asked of everyone while protecting public services, making record investment in the NHS, and cutting debt and borrowing. ## Taxation of income from assets The government is taking action to ensure income from assets is taxed more fairly. Those with property, dividend or savings income pay less tax than those whose income comes from employment or self-employment as they do not pay NICs. The government is increasing taxes on property, dividend and savings income to narrow the gap between tax paid on work and tax paid on income from assets, raising revenue in a way that limits impacts on growth. Increases to the tax paid on income from assets will raise \u00a32.2 billion in 2029 -30 in a fair and progressive way. The government is: - Creating separate tax rates for property income. From April 2027, the property basic rate will be 22%, the property higher rate will be 42%, and the property additional rate will be 47%. - Increasing the ordinary and upper rates of tax on dividend income by 2 percentage points from April 2026. There is no change to the dividend additional rate. - Increasing the tax rate on savings income by 2 percentage points across all bands from April 2027. The majority of taxpayers and the majority of pensioners have no taxable savings, dividend or property income and will pay no more tax as a result of these changes. [footnote 109] In particular, over 90% of taxpayers do not pay savings tax. [footnote 110] In 2029-30, around two thirds of the revenue from the increases to the property, dividend, and savings tax rates is expected to come from the top 20% of households. Those with small amounts of income from assets will continue to be protected by tax-free allowances, and all taxpayers will continue to benefit from the protection offered by Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs). Interest and dividends received on assets"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "held within ISAs will continue to be entirely tax-free. The changes to property income rates will apply in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The government will engage with the devolved governments of Scotland and Wales to provide them with the ability to set property income rates in line with their current income tax powers in their fiscal frameworks. The changes to dividend and savings income rates will apply UK-wide as these rates are reserved. ## Taxation of wealth Property is one of the most significant asset classes in which wealth is held in the UK. Although substantial revenue is raised from property-related taxation, the largest source of revenue, Council Tax, falls disproportionately on those in less expensive properties. Put simply, the typical family home across England currently pays more per year than a \u00a310 million property in Mayfair. [footnote 111] At the Budget, the government is asking those owning the highest-value properties to contribute more. The government is introducing a High Value Council Tax Surcharge (HVCTS) in England for residential properties worth \u00a32 million or more, from April 2028. This charge will be based on updated valuations to identify properties above the threshold and will be in addition to existing Council Tax. Fewer than 1% of properties will be in scope of HVCTS. [footnote 112] New charges start at \u00a32,500 per year, rising to \u00a37,500 per year for properties valued above \u00a35 million, and will be levied on property owners rather than occupiers. Local authorities will collect this revenue on behalf of central government and will be fully compensated for the additional costs of administering this new tax. Revenue will be used to support funding for local services, with further consideration through the next spending review in 2027. The government will consult on detailed implementation of the HVCTS in the new year, including to determine who might need additional support to pay the charge and how to deliver it. Private jets provide a bespoke, high-convenience form of travel, often used by wealthier individuals and some businesses. However, only a small number of private jets currently pay the higher rate of Air Passenger Duty (APD). Many private jet journeys do not meet the criteria for the higher rate and subsequently pay the same APD rates as commercial airline passengers. Therefore, following a consultation, the government will extend the scope of the higher rate of APD to cover all private jets above 5.7 tonnes from April 2027. Extending the scope of the higher rate ensures the tax is applied consistently and that those who can afford to fly privately make a fair contribution alongside commercial air passengers. The government is also reforming existing tax reliefs that are growing in cost and disproportionately benefit higher earners or the wealthy, ensuring that they remain proportionate and targeted. The current CGT relief available on qualifying disposals to Employee Ownership Trusts (EOTs) allows business owners to sell their shares without paying any CGT, with around half of the relief going to the largest 10% of disposals."}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "[footnote 113] The cost of the relief has increased significantly in recent years. The original costing from 2013 suggested the entire EOT tax regime would cost less than \u00a3100 million in 2018-19. [footnote 114] The cost of the CGT relief alone reached \u00a3600 million in 2021-22 and forecasts suggest it could rise to more than 20 times the original costing to \u00a32 billion by 2028-29 without action. [footnote 115] , [footnote 116] The government will retain a strong incentive for employee ownership whilst ensuring that business owners pay their fair share of tax, by reducing the relief available on these disposals from 100% of the gain to 50%. The government is making changes to salary sacrifice arrangements for pension contributions to increase fairness, while protecting ordinary workers. The government supports all individuals to save into pensions through a generous system of tax reliefs, worth over \u00a370 billion a year. [footnote 117] Salary sacrifice into pension schemes is forecast to almost treble in cost, from \u00a32.8 billion in 2016-17 to \u00a38 billion by 2030-31, with the biggest benefits going to the pension contributions for higher earners and minimum wage employees excluded. The government is therefore capping the amount that can be sacrificed without paying NICs at \u00a32,000 per employee from 2029, protecting lower earners, while retaining generous tax relief on pension contributions in full. This pragmatic approach to controlling costs means that employees who contribute up to \u00a32,000 into their pension each year via salary sacrifice can continue to benefit in full, but employee and employer NICs will be charged in the usual way on the amount above \u00a32,000 for the minority of those who contribute above this. The cap means 74% of basic rate taxpayers, and their employers, currently using salary sacrifice will be unaffected by this change. [footnote 118] ## 3.3 Reforming the tax system for the modern economy The taxation of motoring is a critical source of funding for public services and investment in infrastructure, including upkeep of the roads. Historically, motoring taxation has been structured around two elements: taxation on the usage of the vehicle (primarily via fuel duty) and taxation on the ownership of the vehicle (primarily via annual Vehicle Excise Duty or VED). The UK's transport sector is in a period of transformative change, with alternative power sources and new technologies revolutionising the global automotive industry. As set out in the government's Modern Industrial Strategy, the UK automotive manufacturing sector is an important driver of growth and jobs, and is pioneering the technologies of the future. The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) will improve air quality, create high-skilled jobs and unlock growth in the clean energy economy. The government is firmly committed to supporting the transition to EVs by making electric cars accessible for everyone. This is key to meeting the UK's Net Zero Goals and will drive growth and productivity across the UK. However, the transition to EVs also brings challenges. All vehicles contribute to congestion and wear and tear on the roads, but"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "drivers of petrol and diesel vehicles pay fuel duty at the pump to contribute their fair share, whereas drivers of electric vehicles do not currently pay an equivalent. This means that, as more people choose to switch to cleaner, greener electric cars, the OBR has forecast fuel duty receipts will decline to around half current levels (around \u00a312 billion) in the 2030s in real terms. [footnote 119] Receipts are then expected to approach zero by 2050. [footnote 120] The government is introducing Electric Vehicle Excise Duty (eVED), a new mileage charge for electric and plug-in hybrid cars, which will come into effect from April 2028. Drivers will pay for their mileage alongside their existing VED. The government has published a consultation which provides further detail on how eVED will work and seeks views on its implementation. The government is protecting motorists' privacy, which means that there will be no requirement to report where and when miles are driven or install trackers in cars. The government will work closely with industry and motoring representative groups on the delivery of the new tax. While it is fair for EV drivers to contribute for their car usage in the same way as those driving petrol and diesel cars, the government is committed to ensuring that driving an EV remains an attractive choice for consumers. Therefore, the tax paid by EV drivers will be around half the fuel duty rate paid by the average petrol/diesel driver, with a reduced rate for plug-in hybrid drivers. When eVED takes effect in April 2028, an average EV driver will pay around \u00a3240 per year or \u00a320 per month. Other vehicle types, such as vans, buses, motorcycles, coaches and HGVs, will be out of scope of eVED when it is introduced, with the transition to electric power for these vehicle types being currently less advanced than for cars. ## Box 2.C: Supporting the electric vehicle transition The government is also announcing specific measures to help consumers choose EVs and to support UK automotive manufacturers, bolstering British industry. This support will be in place immediately across both the tax system and additional spending: - The Electric Car Grant launched in July this year has already helped over 35,000 drivers to make the switch to an EV by giving up to \u00a33,750 off eligible EV models. The government is boosting the programme with an additional \u00a31.3 billion of funding and extending it to run until 2029 -30 to support more consumers to switch. - The government is increasing the threshold at which motorists with new EVs have to pay the VED Expensive Car Supplement from \u00a340,000 to \u00a350,000, with effect from 1 April 2026, saving over a million motorists \u00a3440 per year. [footnote 121] - The government will delay changes to benefit-in-kind rules for Employee Car Ownership Schemes until April 2030. For those still in contracts at that time, transitional arrangements will also be put in place to provide additional support. - To support the UK automotive manufacturing sector, the"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "government will extend funding for the Drive35 programme, allocating a further \u00a31.5 billion to 2035 and taking total funding to \u00a34 billion over the next 10 years. This will support the development of UK capability in next generation, zero emission technology, ensuring the UK remains globally competitive. - The revenue generated from eVED will also support investment in maintaining and improving the condition of roads across the country, benefitting all motorists. By 2029-30, the government will commit over \u00a32 billion annually for local authorities to repair, renew, and fix potholes on their roads - doubling funding since coming into office. This record level of funding is enough to fill millions of potholes each year, enabling the government to exceed its commitment to fix an additional one million potholes per year. The implementation of eVED will provide revenues for this new higher level of roads maintenance funding to be continued for the long term. The government recognises the importance of effective and accessible charging infrastructure to support the EV transition and is taking action, including reinvesting eVED revenues, to support this: - Investing an additional \u00a3100 million in EV charging infrastructure, building on the \u00a3400 million of funding announced at Spending Review 2025. This includes funding to support the installation of home and workplace chargepoints, adding to the around a million already installed. - Allocating \u00a3100 million of resource funding for local authorities and public bodies to support the training and deployment of specialist staff, accelerating the rollout of public chargepoints. These investments will build on the almost 87,000 public chargepoints already available across the country. - Launching a consultation on permitted development rights for cross -pavement EV charging, which will make gaining access to EV charging quicker and cheaper for households without driveways. This is on top of the \u00a325 million scheme announced in July to support local authorities to provide discreet cross-pavement channel charging solutions for residents. - Introducing a 10-year 100% business rates relief for eligible EV chargepoints and EV-only forecourts, to ensure that they face no business rates liability. Accompanying this, the government will extend the 100% first year allowances (FYAs) for zero emission cars and EV chargepoint infrastructure by a further year. - The government is already taking action to bring down energy costs for consumers and businesses, but the price of public EV charging has risen in recent years. The government will review the cost of public EV charging, looking at the impact of energy prices, wider cost contributors, and options for lowering these costs for consumers. The review will start in Q1 2026 and report by Q3 2026. The government will put an end to some private hire vehicle operators (PHVOs) trying to exploit an administrative scheme intended for tour operators to lower their effective VAT rate. This will ensure that, from 2 January 2026, all PHVOs in London, and all PHVOs who operate as 'principal' nationally, will pay VAT in the same way. At Autumn Budget 2024, the government confirmed a flat-rate excise"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "duty at \u00a32.20 per 10ml on all vaping liquid which will come into effect from 1 October 2026. The government also set out a path for uprating tobacco duties by Retail Prices Index (RPI) +2%. Alcohol duty will be uprated with the RPI on 1 February 2026 to maintain its current real-terms value. The government heard representations from stakeholders ranging from a duty cut or freeze to above inflation increases. This decision balances the important contribution of alcohol producers and the hospitality sector to the UK's culture and economy, with the duty's role in reducing alcohol harm. Online gambling has grown and, while many people in the UK enjoy it in moderation, for others it can cause harm. Earlier this year, the government consulted on proposals for a new single remote betting and gaming duty. Following feedback on the different nature of these activities, and higher levels of harm associated with remote gaming compared with remote betting, the government will not be proceeding with this proposal. The government is instead raising duties on online gambling, with a larger increase on gaming: - Remote Gaming Duty will increase from 21% to 40% from April 2026. - A new Remote Betting Rate at 25% within General Betting Duty will be introduced from April 2027, maintaining a clear differential in the tax rates for these two activities. - Recognising the unique circumstances of the horseracing industry, the government will exclude remote bets on horseracing from the new Remote Betting Rate. Duty on remote horserace betting will remain at 15%. - Bingo Duty will be abolished from April 2026. - An additional \u00a326 million of funding will be provided to the Gambling Commission over the next three years to tackle the illicit market. The 2024 Corporate Tax Roadmap set out the government's commitment to maintain the key features of the UK's Corporation Tax (CT) system, including a competitive main CT rate of 25%, the generous full expensing offer for plant and machinery, and the flexible and competitive regime for intangible assets. From April 2026, the government will decrease the main rate of writing down allowances by four percentage points to 14%. Recognising the need to incentivise future investment and encourage growth in the UK economy, from 1 January 2026 the government will also introduce a new first-year allowance of 40% for main -rate assets, preserving incentives to invest. Cars, second-hand assets and assets for leasing overseas will not be eligible. ## Further reforms to close the tax gap The government is taking further steps to close the tax gap. It is essential everyone pays the tax they owe to support a fair tax system. At Autumn Budget 2024, the government announced the most ambitious-ever package of measures to close the tax gap. Further action at the Budget builds on this and will raise \u00a32.4 billion in additional tax revenue in 2029-30. This brings the total additional revenue raised by closing the tax gap this Parliament to \u00a310 billion in 2029-30. The government is raising"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "this revenue by pursuing those who try to bend or break the rules, collecting more unpaid taxes and modernising the tax system. The government is taking significant action to pursue those who attempt to bend or break the rules. This includes launching a strengthened reward scheme for informants who provide valuable information which allows HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to tackle high-value avoidance or evasion, modelled on the US scheme. The government will also undertake additional high-street enforcement activity, crack down on illicit vapes and disqualify more rogue directors who abuse the insolvency process to evade tax. Following extensive consultation, the government will legislate to further close in on promoters of tax avoidance. The government is determined to collect more unpaid taxes. Building on the significant steps already taken, the government is investing further in HMRC's debt management work and publishing a new tax debt strategy which outlines plans to deliver year-on-year reductions to the overall tax debt balance as a percentage of tax receipts. The government is also taking steps to ensure income tax Self Assessment taxpayers pay tax automatically via regular payments throughout the year. The government is investing in HMRC to modernise the tax system and help taxpayers get their taxes right first time through greater digitalisation. This investment will improve how HMRC uses information from third parties, and to build new technology to increase the use of data-driven prompts to help taxpayers avoid errors when submitting tax returns. From April 2029, businesses will be required to issue all VAT invoices as e-invoices, with a roadmap on implementation to be published next year. ## 3.4 Public services - efficiency, saving and reform The government is maintaining public investment at the highest sustained level in four decades, supported by an increase in departmental capital spending of over \u00a3120 billion over the Parliament, compared with previous plans. This was made possible because of the decisions taken over the last year, including introducing new, non-negotiable fiscal rules. The government's fiscal rules mean that day-to-day spending will be fully funded by tax receipts, whilst ensuring debt is falling as a share of the economy. The government is meeting the stability rule a year early, meaning that, from 2028 -29, the government will only borrow to invest. Day-to-day spending will be \u00a350 billion higher in 2028-29 compared with plans set out at Spring Budget 2024. This has enabled the government to deliver on its mandate to stabilise and improve public services. Since the start of the Parliament, the government has invested in the country's public services, including by providing record investment in the NHS and the infrastructure that strengthens the economy and improves people's day-to-day lives. The state must become more productive: this investment is underpinned by a programme of efficiencies and reforms to deliver public services that are more efficient, effective and better value. ## Chart 2.2: Total Departmental Spending ( DEL) Note: Real-terms figures for each fiscal event are calculated using the OBR's GDP deflator forecast published alongside each event."}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "Source: HM Treasury, Public Spending Statistics. ## Investing in public services and infrastructure Since the start of the Parliament, the government has: - Delivered an extra 5.2 million NHS appointments for planned care in England, supporting a reduction of over 230,000 in the elective waiting list. [footnote 122] , [footnote 123] - Provided additional funding of \u00a31.1 billion in 2025-26 for general practice, recruited over 2,500 more GPs in just under 18 months, and cut red tape so doctors can spend more time caring for patients. As a result, patient satisfaction with general practice is now on the rise after years of decline.

This enables the Armed Forces to keep the country safe and support NATO allies. This includes deploying a Royal Navy patrol ship and RAF P-8 maritime surveillance aircraft to monitor, track and deter a Russian spy ship, joining NATO air defence missions over Poland, and deploying specialist units to counter drone threats in Belgium. It also underpins the UK's commitment to supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes, including playing a leading role in the Coalition of the Willing. - Announced a national Digital ID scheme that will make it easier for citizens to use and access government services whilst helping combat illegal working. The new digital identity check will help enable participation in a modern digital society and facilitate the shift towards mandatory digital right to work checks in this country by the end of the Parliament. The government has continued to drive efficiencies and reform, ensuring that taxpayers' money is spent wisely: - Asking the Office for Value for Money (OVfM) to support departments to develop credible plans to deliver almost \u00a314 billion of technical efficiencies per annum by 2028-29, including by automating administrative tasks and"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "cracking down on fraud. - Rooting out wasteful spending, building on the first HM Treasury-led (HMT) line-by-line review of day-to-day spending in 18 years at Spending Review 2025 (SR25). Since the SR, departments have gone further, including through - an almost \u00a31 billion reduction in costly NHS agency spend in 2024-25, and clamping down on consultancy in the Home Office, with funding repurposed for frontline police. - Reforming public services to make sure taxpayers' money delivers better outcomes and better value, including: investing \u00a32.4 billion into children's social care to deliver early intervention and support to up to 400,000 families; reforming sentencing based on the Independent Sentencing Review, alongside investing \u00a34.7 billion in new prison places between 2026-27 and 2029-30 to help make the justice system more effective; starting to reform the benefits system to ensure that work pays, saving \u00a32 billion per annum by the end of the Parliament; and setting out ambitious long-term reform in the 10 Year Health Plan to transform the NHS. ## Box 2.D: The Office for Value for Money Autumn Budget 2024 established the OVfM as a small, time-limited organisation to support decision-making in SR25 and to develop reforms to improve the value for money of public spending. The OVfM's clear remit allowed it to target longstanding value-for-money issues in public spending. It was not intended to be a permanent addition to, or duplicate the work of, the existing structures and frameworks across government that are designed to deliver value for money. ## Ahead of SR25, the OVfM: - Worked with departments to agree bespoke efficiency targets, underpinned by credible delivery plans, amounting to almost \u00a314 billion of technical efficiencies per annum by 2028-29. - Conducted two value-for-money studies into high-risk areas of cross -departmental spending - the governance and budgeting arrangements for mega projects, and the procurement of short-term residential accommodation - the findings of which were published in the 10 Year Infrastructure Strategy. - Scrutinised a subset of capital and invest-to-save proposals. - Recommended reforms to the spending framework which were accepted by the government. These included a requirement for all departments to deliver at least 1% technical efficiencies a year in future years, supported by the biennial publication of delivery plans and the introduction of a programme of thematic value for money reviews. Since then, the OVfM has: - Led work across government to reform the public spending control and accountability framework. These changes, published alongside the Budget in 'Reforming the spending control and accountability framework' will see the business of government become more efficient, effective and able to make quicker and better decisions, increasing capacity and speed of delivery. Changes will strengthen accountability for decisions and will ultimately mean better and faster outcomes for people. - Published 10 Year Efficiency Projections for a selection of programmes funded at SR25. These forecasts begin to address a longstanding criticism that successive governments have focused too much on short-term issues in public spending at the expense of decisions that would provide benefits in"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "the long run. Increased transparency will ensure departments have greater accountability for delivering efficiencies over the longer term, providing HM Treasury with greater confidence that these investments will be value for money. This prototype report will support departments to develop their modelling capability to enable a greater focus on long-term value for money. Reforms to the controls and accountability framework will be implemented by the government from the start of the next financial year. The OVfM has delivered successfully. Its functions have been embedded within HM Treasury, leaving a legacy of value-for-money improvements across the public sector. The OVfM has published a report setting out what it has delivered, how it approached its task, and how its reforms will be taken forward and implemented by permanent teams in HM Treasury, Cabinet Office, and across government. HM Treasury has undertaken and published an evaluation of the OVfM, which concluded that the OVfM had delivered its remit, its recommendations are likely to have a meaningful impact and it had made effective use of its resources. The government appointed the Covid Counter-Fraud Commissioner to use every means possible to recoup public money lost in pandemic-related fraud and undelivered contracts. The Commissioner's interim report found that failed pandemic-era Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) contracts cost \u00a31.4 billion due to over-ordering and delayed verification. Following the Commissioner's recommendations, the government launched a three-month voluntary repayment window for ineligible support scheme funds and the Covid Fraud Reporting Site for anonymous fraud reporting. [footnote 126] The government is estimated to deliver almost \u00a3400 million of Covid fraud and error benefits to date and will relentlessly pursue more cases through the new Public Authorities Fraud Investigation and Enforcement Service and further action on Covid loans. The Commissioner will present his final report to Parliament shortly. The government is standing by the commitments it has made over the last year to invest in the NHS and capital infrastructure. At the Budget, the government is: - Ensuring continued progress to reduce the waiting list for elective care by protecting investment in the NHS in England, including by announcing plans for 250 new Neighbourhood Health Centres to improve patient access to care and an increase in technology budgets to support NHS productivity. - Investing in defence and the country's national security, including \u00a31.5 billion over the Parliament in energetics and munitions, with construction to start next year after identifying 13 potential factories for manufacturing munitions and explosive devices. - Investing in capital infrastructure, supporting new transport links, new homes and greater energy security across the country and going further by announcing additional investment in major growth projects, such as the Lower Thames Crossing. ## Box 2E: NHS investment The government is prioritising the NHS in England. That is why the government is allowing the NHS to retain and reinvest the efficiency savings that it will deliver in 2028-29. The Budget also announces \u00a3300 million of additional capital investment in NHS technology to boost productivity, support staff and improve patient outcomes, driving the"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "shift from analogue to digital. This builds on up to \u00a310 billion announced at Spending Review 2025 and will ensure seamless navigation and communication between primary and secondary care through the NHS App. By guiding patients to self-care, primary care and urgent care through a single user-facing service, their information will be made readily available across all providers. This funding will also close the gap in patient access to digital health records, so patients can make informed choices about their care. The government is also establishing 250 new Neighbourhood Health Centres across England, of which 120 will be operational by 2030, co-locating local health services such as GPs and physiotherapists to improve access to care and support a more preventative and sustainable NHS. These will be located across the country, with early new sites in Birmingham, Barrow-in-Furness, Truro and Southall, and will build on successful models already operating in Hull and Barnsley. The new Neighbourhood Health Centres will be delivered through the NHS Neighbourhood Rebuild Programme which will upgrade and repurpose underused buildings and build new facilities through a combination of public investment and Public-Private Partnerships. To ensure transparent management and fiscal sustainability, these projects will be budgeted for as if they were on the government's balance sheet. This investment builds on the record capital budget that the government has allocated for health, which is already enabling the delivery of 1,000 extra NHS estate repair projects this year. The government's investment is also helping to unlock broader economic impacts and get people back into work. Since July 2024, the waiting list for planned care has fallen by over 230,000, making progress against the government's Plan for Change (PfC) target of 92% of patients starting consultant-led treatment within 18 weeks of referral by the end of Parliament. [footnote 127] Recent analysis highlights that delivery of the PfC target could lead to over 10,000 more people in employment and an increase of at least \u00a31.1 billion to total wage income in 2030-31. [footnote 128] The increase in total wage income reflects increases in the number of people in work, number of hours worked, and pay per hour. Meeting the PfC target will ensure that people receive treatment earlier, enabling these individuals to recover and either return to work or avoid giving up work in the first place, increasing their hours worked and overall productivity. The government is taking steps to improve the productivity and efficiency of the NHS in England, including: - Increasing NHS productivity by 2% per year, which will unlock \u00a317 billion of savings in England over three years to be reinvested back into the health service. - Abolishing NHS England and significantly reducing the headcount and running costs of Integrated Care Boards. This is supported by bringing forward \u00a3860 million of the Department of Health and Social Care's SR25 settlement to cover the upfront costs of abolishing NHS England. By reducing unnecessary bureaucracy and duplication, the government will unlock savings of \u00a31 billion per year by the end of"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "the Parliament, equivalent to the cost of over 115,000 extra hip and knee operations. [footnote 129] - Reducing NHS trusts' spend on costly agency staffing by at least 30% in this financial year. This will build on an almost \u00a31 billion reduction in agency spend in 2024-25 and progress plans to eliminate the use of all agency staff by the end of the Parliament. [footnote 130] ## Taking the necessary decisions Taxpayers rightly expect that every penny of public money is spent wisely. The government is therefore taking focused and credible action to deliver a more productive state, including: - Committing to a further \u00a32.8 billion of efficiencies and savings in 2028-29, rising to \u00a34.9 billion by 2030-31 - this is in addition to almost \u00a314 billion of technical efficiencies announced at SR25. The 2028-29 efficiencies and savings target will apply to all departments, with the NHS and Ministry of Defence allowed to retain and reinvest the savings to improve patient care and protect national security. - Saving over \u00a3250 million to 2030-31 by cutting the cost of politics. This includes abolishing Police and Crime Commissioners and re-organising local government structures, with the potential to reduce the number of councillors in local authorities by around 5,000 to generate savings and streamline accountability in local areas. - Delivering a leaner civil service: reducing back-office administration costs by 16% by 2029-30, to save money and focus resources on frontline services. - Tightening up the asylum system to cut down on wasteful spend, reduce costs, and reform the core protection offer for refugees to make it less attractive. To date, the government has reclaimed \u00a374 million from asylum accommodation suppliers and is going further by reforming the wider immigration system to recognise that settlement in the UK is a privilege and that individuals should contribute to the economy and society. [footnote 131] - Accelerating efforts to recoup funds lost to fraud and error: going further on reviewing Department for Work and Pensions benefit claims to tackle fraud and error in the welfare system, including by expanding Targeted Case Review, which will save an additional \u00a31.3 billion in 2030-31, and accelerating the recovery of pandemic-related fraud through the Public Authorities Fraud Investigation and Enforcement Service and further action on Covid loans. ## Box 2.F: Reforming the asylum and immigration system The Home Secretary has announced changes to put fairness back at the heart of the asylum and migration system and rebuild confidence in the management of the UK's borders. Refugees will have to wait 20 years for settlement rather than five, and the core protection offer they receive is being changed to make it less attractive and encourage contribution. Individuals will be required to contribute towards the costs of their asylum where they have some assets or income. The Home Office will also recover costs where assets are not convertible into cash or declared at the point asylum support is provided, but become convertible or are discovered at a later date. Alongside this, the"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "Department for Work and Pensions will consult on changing the rules for benefits to prioritise access for long-term residents and those who are making an economic contribution to the UK. The government is cutting down on wasteful asylum expenditure to ensure that nobody is profiting unfairly from taxpayers' money. This includes reclaiming \u00a374 million from asylum accommodation suppliers. The government is also reducing the cost of asylum, making the system more efficient, and exiting asylum hotels. This will include expediting appeals through a new independent body, incentivising voluntary returns and pursuing more enforced returns. The government has also launched a consultation on a new model of Earned Settlement for legal migrants, recognising that settlement in the UK is a privilege that should be earned based on an individual's contribution to the economy and society. Subject to consultation, the new model will increase the baseline qualifying period from five to 10 years for most migrants, and 20 years for refugees, with reductions for individuals who meet certain integration and contribution criteria, and longer waits or refusals for those who do not comply with immigration laws. The pathway will remain at three years for highly talented individuals on specific visa routes, recognising the contribution they make to the economy. These measures put fairness and contribution at the core of the asylum and immigration system, ensuring taxpayer money is better spent and that people pay back into the system when they can. The welfare system is not working as it should, forcing too many sick people out of work and on to benefits. The government has already taken action, by rebalancing the rates of Universal Credit (UC) to support people into work, including reducing the Health Element for new claimants, saving \u00a32.8 billion in 2030-31. This is supported by \u00a31 billion per annum of additional investment by 2029-30 in employment support. The Keep Britain Working review, led by Sir Charlie Mayfield, has launched a roadmap to address health-related inactivity in the workplace. The Budget goes further, by making available more than \u00a31.5 billion over the spending review period for investment in employment and skills support. This funds \u00a3820 million for the Youth Guarantee and provides \u00a3725 million for the Growth and Skills Levy, ensuring young people have access to high-quality training opportunities and the support they need to earn or learn. In the previous Parliament, nearly 13% of UC payments were lost to fraud and error. That is why the government announced the biggest ever package of measures to tackle fraud and error at Autumn Budget 2024, saving \u00a34.3 billion in 2029-30. The Budget is extending the Targeted Case Review, which will save an additional \u00a31.3 billion in 2030-31. The Budget announces further reforms to ensure the welfare system delivers value for money. The government is improving the way people are assessed for health-related benefits by increasing the number of people who undergo face -to -face assessments.

The Motability Scheme supports the independence of disabled people. However, it benefits from generous tax breaks which are subsidising provision beyond the scheme's core objectives, such as the lease of luxury cars. The government will limit the tax breaks available to Motability, and other qualifying schemes, saving over \u00a31 billion over the next five years. VAT relief for top-up payments made to lease more expensive vehicles will be removed for new leases from July 2026, and Insurance Premium Tax will apply at the standard rate to insurance contracts on the Scheme. The VAT reliefs on weekly lease costs and vehicle resale will remain in place, and the tax changes will not apply to vehicles designed for, or substantially and permanently adapted for, wheelchair or stretcher users. These tax changes ensure Motability can continue to deliver for its customers, for example through the continued provision of a broad range of vehicle models available without any top-up payments. Disability benefit payments and their eligibility will remain unaffected by these changes. Alongside these changes, Motability Operations will better focus their scheme on achieving its core aims. Motability will remove luxury vehicles from the scheme, discontinue the inclusion of overseas breakdown cover and reduce their lease mileage limit. This will bring Motability leases more in line with those available commercially to most people. The government is launching an independent investigation to tackle rising youth inactivity, led by the former Health Secretary, the Rt Hon Alan Milburn. This will focus on preventing young people from becoming trapped out of work, education or training, helping to cut the long-term costs of youth inactivity, and make the social security system more sustainable. The government has also launched the Rt Hon Sir Stephen Timms' review into Personal Independence Payment, coproduced with disability groups to ensure the system is fit for the future. The government will also consult on the rules for taxpayer-funded benefits to prioritise access for long-term residents and those who are making an economic contribution to the UK. The government is closing loopholes in current Voluntary National Insurance contributions (VNICs) rules that allow those with a limited connection to the UK to build UK State Pension entitlement at a cheaper rate whilst overseas. To fix the most unfair elements of these rules, the government is removing access to the cheapest Class 2 VNICs for individuals abroad and increasing the initial residency or contributions requirement for VNICs to 10 years. The government is also launching a wider review of VNICs, with a call for evidence to be published in the new year. The government is taking steps to ensure that public funding is spent wisely and fairly, and it is only right that the devolved governments take similar steps to deliver value for money and to live within their means. Following the Budget, the devolved governments will continue to receive over 20% more funding per head than the equivalent government spending in"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "the rest of the UK. ## Delivering better value public services Ahead of the next spending review in 2027, the government is continuing to focus on efficiencies and savings, committing to targeted reviews across public services and welfare. This will enable more productive, effective public services that deliver better outcomes and better value. Detailed spending plans that are shaped by the results of this work will be set out at the next spending review. Each department will appoint a Non-Executive Director to identify opportunities for additional efficiencies and savings. They will use their external experience to challenge how things can be done better and with fewer resources, whilst protecting outcomes for the public. This builds on Departmental Efficiency Plans published at SR25 which will deliver almost \u00a314 billion of technical efficiencies by 2028-29. [footnote 132] The government will review its public bodies and assets to ensure they are delivering best value for taxpayers, including: - Implementing the findings of the recently completed arm's length body (ALB) review to improve accountability, efficiency and delivery, as part of wider policy and delivery reforms across government. Further work to make ALBs and the ALB landscape more efficient, effective and accountable will be conducted ahead of the next spending review. The government will build on this to review regulations and regulators, simplifying the regulatory landscape to make it more efficient, accessible and less costly for businesses, including reducing duplication, to support the growth agenda - this will feed into the next spending review. - Reviewing the public sector asset portfolio to ensure government property and resources are proactively managed on behalf of taxpayers, improving public service outcomes and generating savings. ## Box 2.G: Managing government assets The government holds \u00a32.7 trillion assets, \u00a3190 billion of which are property, plant and equipment. [footnote 133] Effective asset management is essential to the efficient delivery of public services and maximising value for money on behalf of taxpayers. This includes: ensuring the assets the government acquires are essential for policy delivery, physical assets like buildings are well maintained and commercialised if there is spare capacity, and surplus assets are repurposed or disposed. As part of a process of reviewing value for money across significant areas of spending, the government will review the maintenance of public assets to further strengthen asset management in government. The government is also introducing a \u00a31 billion asset efficiency target to be met by 2030 through asset disposals and generation of new income from public sector assets, such as leveraging public sector data assets. In addition to the existing \u00a31 billion estate disposal target, this means the government will generate \u00a32 billion in proceeds from the government's asset base on behalf of taxpayers. The government is already making headway against the asset efficiency target at the Budget through the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office's (FCDO's) plans for FCDO 2030 and an Overseas Network Review.

Rationalising the overseas estate, which is comprised of around 6,500 properties, will form a critical part of this programme, through which the government will identify whether there are assets to release, including in high-cost locations such as New York. Additionally, the government has confirmed \u00a32 billion further asset disposals at the Budget by ensuring its liabilities are funded in the most efficient way. In line with the principles set out in the Balance Sheet Framework, liabilities held by the Atomic Weapons Establishment pension scheme and the Nuclear Liabilities Fund will no longer be pre-funded. This does not change the government's obligation to pay the liabilities when they are due, nor does it change the terms or benefits of pension scheme members. The government will launch a Strategic Asset Review to report before the next spending review, which will identify opportunities to monetise assets and address barriers to disposals. Both this and the value-for-money review into the maintenance of public sector assets will be informed by the Balance Sheet Framework, setting out for the first time a comprehensive approach to managing the assets and liabilities that the government holds on behalf of the taxpayer. Alongside this, HS2 Ltd is undertaking a sprint project that aims to identify and unlock opportunities for early release of land currently held for HS2 between London and Birmingham, around its stations and depot hub. This work is part of the reset of the HS2 programme and will support both regeneration and economic growth. As recommended by the OVfM, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury will lead a review of value for money across government spending. This will include reviewing: - New models of care within the NHS and communities, as part of implementing the 10 Year Health Plan, to help shape a system that delivers earlier intervention and preventative care where possible. - Youth provision, to better align with the ambitions of the National Youth Strategy and maximise the value and impact of out-of-classroom support for young people. - Homelessness services, to assess funding and delivery models, including ways to improve the supply of good value for money and good quality temporary accommodation and supported housing, such as greater coordination and planning in procurement between different parts of the state. - Maintenance of public assets, to protect the value and function of the infrastructure, buildings and equipment that deliver public services. This work will build evidence and potential solutions ahead of the next spending review so that government support delivers better outcomes and better value for money. The Department for Education will also lead a review of childcare provision. The purpose of this review is to simplify the system for providers and families, making it easier to access childcare and increasing the overall impact of the government's offer.

This work builds on the announcement of the \u00a3500 million 10-year Better Futures Fund, which the government plans to open for applications next year. The government is trialling place-based budgets in five Mayoral Strategic Authorities to test how the pooling of public service budgets in local areas could break down siloes, unlock more funding for prevention, and help deliver better outcomes for taxpayers. The government's new planning and performance framework focuses on delivering the Plan for Change and securing strong outcomes for taxpayers. In Spring 2026, departments will publish the outcomes that were funded at SR25 and their first set of annual strategic plans. ## 4. Secure Future ## 4.1 Summary The government's number one mission is to achieve higher economic growth and raise living standards by creating strong foundations today to secure Britain's long-term future. The UK has considerable economic strengths. It is the second largest services exporter in the world, the second most attractive location to invest in Europe and is ranked sixth in the Global Innovation Index. [footnote 134] , [footnote 135] The UK is also home to one of the world's leading financial centres, Europe's leading tech and AI ecosystem and 4 of the world's top 10 universities. [footnote 136] Despite these strengths, the UK has had sluggish productivity growth, and the global macroeconomic environment has remained uncertain. Productivity growth since the global financial crisis (GFC) has been weak. Between 2010 and 2019, annual productivity growth averaged 0.6%, down by around 1.5 percentage points from an average of 2.1% in the decade prior to the GFC (1998-2007). If productivity growth had continued at the pre-GFC rate, then GDP per capita could have been around \u00a315,000 higher in 2024. [footnote 137] Lower productivity growth is associated with lower growth in wages and living standards in the long run. The government continues to tackle these challenges in pursuit of economic renewal. This starts with creating the right economic environment for sustainable growth by ensuring stability. The government has taken the responsible decisions to secure sustainable public finances which contribute to reducing inflationary pressure, supporting the independent Bank of England to bring inflation sustainably to target and reduce interest rates. Since July 2024, the government has recognised the need for decisive policy action to deliver sustainably higher economic growth and achieve higher living standards across the UK. The government's strategy is built on three principles: restoring economic and fiscal stability; increasing investment; and reforming the supply side of the economy. [footnote 138] This strategy recognises that growth comes from businesses, investors and working people, but that the government should play an active, enabling role in partnership with businesses to create the conditions for them to innovate, create good jobs, and grow. Stability is the foundation"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "upon which all else is built. The government has taken the necessary decisions to put the public finances on a firm footing and repair public services. The government's fiscal rules enable an increase in public investment, alongside a clear plan to grow the economy and bring net financial debt down in this parliament. Investment is critical to growth. The government has committed over \u00a3120 billion of additional departmental capital spending over the course of the Parliament, made possible by its fiscal rules. [footnote 139] This investment is being directed to infrastructure and planning priorities that support growth, including supporting regional growth by bringing new affordable homes and improved transport connectivity to more places and supporting energy and net zero priorities through new nuclear power. The National Wealth Fund and the British Business Bank are catalysing private investment and the new National Housing Bank will extend that catalytic effect to the housing market. The strategy is working: the UK is attracting international investment, with \u00a3150 billion of new confirmed inward investment commitments at the US State Visit in September and further commitments at the Regional Investment Summit in October. [footnote 140] , [footnote 141] Reform to the supply side of the economy is necessary to improve the conditions for growth and investment, including removing barriers faced by businesses. The government has brought forward reforms to planning, with reforms to the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) forecast to add 0.4% to GDP by 2034-35; skills reform, to equip people businesses with the skilled workforce they need to drive growth; and pensions reforms that will unlock \u00a350 billion of investment for business and infrastructure. [footnote 142] , [footnote 143] The government has also struck major trade agreements to increase cooperation and reduce barriers, including with the European Union, the United States and India. [footnote 144] , [footnote 145] , [footnote 146] The new modern Industrial Strategy is targeting high-growth sectors; the government will reduce the annual administrative burden of regulation by \u00a35.6 billion by the end of Parliament through its Regulation Action Plan, and the government is delivering the Leeds Reforms, the most wide-ranging reforms to financial services regulation in a decade, to enable firms to take risks and drive growth. [footnote 147] At the same time, the government's reforms are unblocking major projects - from reservoirs to wind farms to a third runway at Heathrow - and providing certainty and stability through the 10-Year Infrastructure Strategy, backed by at least \u00a3725 billion over the next decade to deliver significant, long-term schemes such as the Oxford to Cambridge and Northern growth corridors. [footnote 148] The government's strategy is focused on strengthening the foundations and delivering long-lasting change. Recent data has shown positive signs; whole economy investment has risen by 4.2% in real terms since the start of the year, out performing the OBR's March forecast for a decline of 0.1%. Over the same period, business investment has increased by 2.7%, above the OBR's March forecast for a growth of 1.1%. [footnote 149] Throughout"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "the autumn and at the Budget, the government is taking the next steps in delivering its growth mission: investing for the future; backing businesses and unlocking innovation; and unleashing talent and opportunity. ## 4.2 Investing for the Future For decades, the UK has suffered from insufficient levels of both private and public investment - failing to build the foundations for future growth. Investment in the UK has been the lowest in the G7 over the past 30 years, averaging 18% of GDP, compared to the average of 21.9% in the rest of the G7. [footnote 150] This has contributed to the UK's weaker productivity performance compared to other economies and weighed on living standards across the country. [footnote 151] Increasing public and private investment is therefore at the heart of the government's growth strategy. The government has committed over \u00a3120 billion of additional departmental capital spending over the course of the Parliament. The Budget is protecting this investment, ensuring it can be directed into growth priorities, including new homes, improved transport connectivity and new nuclear projects. At the Spending Review in June, the government committed over \u00a315 billion to connect the UK's cities and towns, \u00a339 billion towards the 10 -year Social and Affordable Homes Programme (SAHP), \u00a314 billion for Sizewell C - to help power more than 6 million homes - and over \u00a322 billion per year for research and development by 2029 -30. [footnote 152] The government has also established the National Wealth Fund to catalyse \u00a370 billion of private sector investment in high-growth sectors at the heart of the government's modern industrial strategy, from gigafactories to green hydrogen. [footnote 153] The government is maintaining public investment at the highest sustained level in four decades, with Public Sector Net Investment (PSNI) averaging 2.7% of GDP over the forecast period. ## Chart 3.1: Public sector net investment Source: Office for National Statistics, Office for Budget Responsibility and HM Treasury calculations. Since July 2024, major private investments into the UK have been announced. These include \u00a3150 billion of inward investment commitments during the US State Visit in September, which are expected to generate over 7,600 high-quality jobs, helping to revitalise communities and accelerate growth. The Regional Investment Summit in October also saw commitments totaling over \u00a310 billion, such as \u00a3400 million to support the \u00a34 billion Birmingham Knowledge Quarter. [footnote 154] , [footnote 155] The 10-Year Infrastructure Strategy, published in June 2025, set out the government's plans to use private finance to support its infrastructure ambitions. The Budget builds on that strategy by confirming that the NHS Neighbourhood Rebuild Programme will deliver new Neighbourhood Health Centres (NHC) through upgrading and repurposing existing buildings, and building new facilities through a combination of public sector investment and a new model of PublicPrivate Partnerships (PPPs). The approach will allow the government to build further evidence and better compare different models of infrastructure delivery. The new PPP model is being developed by the National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority, supported by the Department of"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "Health and Social Care, and will build on lessons learnt from past and current models and harness private sector expertise to deliver the new NHCs. To ensure the NHC PPPs are managed transparently and are fiscally sustainable, these projects will be budgeted for as if they are on balance sheet. The government will continue to consider the ways in which private finance can support the delivery of wider infrastructure ambitions including leveraging private finance to help deliver the next generation of new towns. Privately financed projects and programmes - including PPPs - will also be considered for projects that decarbonise the public sector estate. The government is making rapid progress in enabling the delivery of an operational third runway at Heathrow by 2035. In October, the Department for Transport launched a review of the Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS) and in November identified the scheme promoted by Heathrow Airport Ltd as the scheme to take forward to inform the ongoing review of the ANPS. The government will consult on any amendments to the ANPS by July 2026. Heathrow expansion will be entirely privately financed, with no cost to the taxpayer. ## Progressing planning reform The government is committed to delivering the most ambitious planning reforms in a generation, principally through the flagship Planning and Infrastructure Bill which sets the foundations to unlock new housing and critical infrastructure delivery - set to become law imminently. [footnote 156] Secondary legislation and guidance to support full implementation will follow including to make pre-application engagement for major infrastructure projects more targeted and proportionate. This is expected to reduce delivery timelines for major infrastructure projects such as roads, reservoirs and energy projects by up to 12 months. The government is also taking a more strategic approach to manage the impact of development on the environment, with Environmental Delivery Plans set to drive pro-growth interventions that provide better benefits for nature than the status quo. The government is going further to streamline and strengthen the planning system. In addition to scrapping the paper permissions stage for judicial reviews impacting major infrastructure projects and removing the right to appeal for cases totally without merit, the government is working with the judiciary to make further reforms to ensure planning cases are heard more quickly and by expert judges. The overall package of Judicial Review reforms could reduce delays by ## up to 6 months. The government has committed to rebuilding Britain by reforming planning rules and fast-tracking 150 planning decisions on major infrastructure by the end of this Parliament. In the 16 months since the start of this Parliament, the government has made 29 decisions on major infrastructure projects, more than any other 16-month period under any previous parliament. These decisions are unlocking development across the country, such as the expansion of Gatwick Airport, solar farms in East Yorkshire, and wind farms in the Irish Sea. Building on last year's pro-growth reforms to the National Planning Policy Framework, the government has announced a series of changes designed to"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "further speed progress through the planning system. In October, the Mayor of London and the government announced a package of support for housebuilding in London, which will improve the viability of housing developments in the near term, boosting the number of new homes - including affordable homes delivered in the coming years. Earlier this month, the government announced it is pressing ahead with the next phase of reforms to the planning system, including default 'yes' to development around train stations. [footnote 157] , [footnote 158] The government is also investing \u00a348 million of additional funding to boost capacity in the planning system. This includes additional investment to recruit an extra 350 planners in England by expanding the Pathways to Planning Graduate Scheme and creating a new Planning Careers Hub to retain and retrain midcareer professionals. The government is also funding improvements to the performance and speed of environmental regulators, with extra resources for priority projects and delivery of the Nature Restoration Fund's Environmental Delivery Plans. This will take the total number of recruitments across the planning system to 1,400 by the end of this Parliament, which will help speed up planning decisions on housing and infrastructure, and support delivery of 1.5 million homes. ## Box 3.A: Economic effects of the Planning and Infrastructure Bill The government has made a range of significant reforms to planning. Together, these reforms will help ensure the UK has a system which supports economic development, and the delivery of 1.5 million homes in England, 150 major infrastructure consents, and commercial premises. These reforms are expected to raise investment through improving investor confidence and enabling more projects to be approved. The Planning and Infrastructure Bill (PIB), which will become law shortly, will further accelerate the delivery of large infrastructure projects by streamlining the approval process for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIPs), reducing regulatory burdens, and cutting the time required to obtain development consent. The PIB will also reduce uncertainty for developers through strengthening and streamlining our planning system, including by requiring up-to-date National Policy Statements (NPS), simplifying environmental compliance, and reducing uncertainty around decision-making. The PIB can raise economic activity via two main channels: - Speed: by shortening the period between project inception and completion, the PIB enables new infrastructure to become operational earlier, raising the level of the capital stock and potential output over the medium term. - Reducing the cost of investment: by reducing regulatory costs, the PIB lowers the effective cost of capital for firms investing in infrastructure. Lower costs and reduced uncertainty make it easier to finance projects, encouraging higher levels of investment and further boosting the capital stock over time. MHCLG have estimated that 25 NSIPs per year, with an average cost of \u00a31 billion, will, on average, cut consenting times by 25%, from four to three years. [footnote 159] Cutting a year from project delivery times (speeding up the flow of investment) would raise the capital stock relative to the baseline over the medium term, given the lags involved in"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "NSIP delivery and scale of investment involved. A higher capital stock raises the capital available per worker in the UK, raising productivity and ultimately economic output. The basis for this assessment is conservative: in order to meet its ambitious target of fast-tracking 150 planning decisions on major infrastructure projects, the government will encourage more than 25 projects a year to come forward and seek to reduce average consenting timeframes to their levels in 2012. The PIB is also assumed to result in estimated annual regulatory cost savings of \u00a3300 million out of a \u00a322 billion total UK burden, implying a reduction in the regulatory burden of 1.5%. [footnote 160] , [footnote 161] Regulatory burdens can be thought of as a tax on production, with regulatory cost savings translating to a reduction in the cost of capital. [footnote 162] These effects combined imply an increase in GDP of around 0.1% at the tenyear horizon, with most of the effect coming from bringing forward investment, and a smaller but positive contribution from lowering the cost of investment. There are also likely to be additional positive effects from the PIB - such as crowding-in of additional investment - that are not captured by these estimates. ## Delivering new homes The government is committed to delivering 1.5 million homes in England this Parliament and has made a series of significant announcements ahead of the Budget, building on the landmark \u00a339 billion Social and Affordable Homes Programme and the new \u00a316 billion National Housing Bank announced in June. In September, the government announced that it will get spades in the ground in at least three new towns in this Parliament, with Tempsford, Leeds South Bank and Crews Hill and Chase Park identified as the most promising sites. Decisions on new town locations will be informed by Strategic Environmental Assessment, with new town locations announced in the spring. Each new town will have at least 10,000 homes. To unlock more new homes across the country, the government is, for the first time ever, devolving housing funds across Greater Manchester, Greater London, Liverpool City Region, the North East, South Yorkshire, West Midlands and West Yorkshire through the integrated settlement. In total, \u00a31.3 billion of the new National Housing Delivery Fund will be devolved, supporting established and non-established MSAs. This will support leaders to deliver ambitious growth projects in their area and develop strategic sites across the country, building on existing government investment in places such as Liverpool Central Docks and Forth Yards in Newcastle. To support additional investment in new and existing social housing, the government consulted on how to implement Social Rent convergence over the summer. Convergence would allow rents for Social Rent properties that are currently below 'formula rent' to increase by an additional amount each year, over and above the CPI+1% limit, until they 'converge' with formula rent. While the government remains committed to implementing Social Rent convergence, it is important to take the time to get the precise details right, taking account of"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "the benefits to the supply and quality of social and affordable housing, the impact on rent payers and affordability. The government will respond to the consultation in full, and announce a decision about how Social Rent convergence will be implemented in January 2026, before the launch of the SAHP. The government also remains committed to the 10-year rent settlement for 2026-36 announced at SR25, which will permit social housing rents to increase by CPI+1% per annum. The government has also published its Defence Housing Strategy, backed by an extra \u00a31.5 billion investment this Parliament and a total of \u00a39 billion over the next decade. [footnote 163] The Ministry of Defence owns, or has rights over, 1.4% of the United Kingdom's land, and the government will accelerate the release and development of surplus Defence land to support delivery of 100,000 homes for both military and civilian families, as well as boosting the wider economy. This will include a new 'Forces First' approach to boost homeownership opportunities for veterans and Armed Forces personnel. The government will not be proceeding at this time with converging the two rates of Landfill Tax, as consulted on earlier this year. The government has listened to stakeholders' arguments made in response to the consultation, and revised its approach to ensure the reforms to Landfill Tax are proportionate, do not impose unavoidable costs on businesses and do not undermine the government's target of building 1.5 million new homes in England. The government will instead prevent the gap between the two rates of Landfill Tax getting any wider over the coming years. The government will also retain the tax exemption for backfilling quarries to ensure that housebuilders and the construction sector continue to have access to a low-cost alternative to landfill. As set out in the 10-Year Infrastructure Strategy, the government is committed to removing the barriers to gigabit-capable broadband, including for people living in flats. In the next few weeks, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology will be consulting on measures to create a new right for leaseholders to request a gigabit broadband connection and a duty for freeholders not to unreasonably refuse the request. Box 3.B: Delivery case study on NPPF reforms and 'grey belt' approvals The new National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) is estimated by the Office for Budget Responsibility to increase annual housebuilding by around 30% by 2029-30, taking net additions to a 40 year high, and resulting in an additional 170,000 homes over the forecast, adding \u00a36.8 billion to the economy. [footnote 164] Since the updated NPPF was introduced in December 2024, an unprecedented 80% of major residential appeals located on grey belt land have been approved, homes that likely wouldn't have been built under previous policy. [footnote 165] Alongside thousands more homes, councils and ministers have approved significant projects on grey belt land too, including data centres, and film studios. For example, following the introduction of the 'grey belt' policy in December, the Minister of State for Housing and Planning approved the"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "\u00a3400 million Sky Studios Elstree North project. Construction is scheduled to start next year, with Sky estimating that the build will create over 600 jobs, and a further 2,000 jobs and \u00a32 billion of production investment to the UK within the first five years of operation. Sky has also pledged \u00a36.5 million for local road upgrades, a new community green and safeguarding 27 acres of land for wildlife. [footnote 166] , [footnote 167] ## Growth across the whole United Kingdom Devolving, investing and reforming to support local leaders in our city regions The Budget builds on the government's approach to long-term, broad-based economic growth, lifting living standards across the country by investing billions in infrastructure, innovation and skills; supporting city regions to be dynamic economic hubs; empowering local leaders to deliver; and reforming how the government works to support them. Mayors are transforming the trajectory of local economies across England by investing in transport, housing and local growth. In recent years, this has driven a step change in the productivity growth rates of cities across the North. The government has announced a historic commitment to fiscal devolution, giving mayors and potentially other local leaders, subject to consultation, the option to introduce a visitor levy on overnight visitor accommodation in their area. [footnote 168] This will fund further investment in growth locally, including the visitor economy. The government is consulting on the design of the levy. The government is also confirming at least \u00a313 billion of SR25 funding via integrated settlements from 2026-27 to 2029-30 for seven Mayoral Strategic Authorities: Greater Manchester, West Midlands, Liverpool City Region, West Yorkshire, North East, South Yorkshire and the Greater London Authority, representing nearly 40% of people in England. This will empower mayors with local control over a single flexible pot for growth and public services priorities, aligned with their local growth plans. The government remains committed to rolling out integrated settlements to more places at the next Spending Review. Building on the recent significant investment in the Pride in Place Programme, the government is continuing to also invest in regeneration and providing \u00a3902 million over four years for a new local growth fund for the 11 mayoral city regions in the North and Midlands with the highest potential for growth. This will allow mayors to invest in key local growth projects, including from their Local Growth Plans. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive \u00a3783 million through a local growth fund to support regeneration across the UK. Alongside this, the government is launching a \u00a3500 million Mayoral Revolving Growth Fund for mayors in the North and Midlands with an integrated settlement, working alongside a wider set of public financial institutions. This will allow mayors in key city regions to invest in game-changing growth projects alongside the private sector, breaking down regional access to finance barriers, and creating new opportunities for businesses in key sectors to grow. MSAs will also be able to bid for around \u00a37 billion through the successor to the Affordable"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "Homes Programme, enabling them to set strategic direction for social and affordable housing in their areas. Building on the government's funding for West Yorkshire Mass Transit, support for the Northern Square Mile, and designation of Leeds South Bank as a promising site for a New Town, the Budget is supporting West Yorkshire Combined Authority by establishing the Leeds City Fund. This is a business rates retention (BRR) zone in Leeds city centre, within which Leeds City Council can retain 100% of business rates growth above an agreed baseline for 25 years. In line with the Fair Funding Review, the government is improving the business rates retention system to more consistently support mayors in driving growth. Options being considered include allocating Mayoral Strategic Authorities a direct share of business rates from across their region, building on Local Growth Plans and allowing more tax to be spent where it is raised. Over the coming months, the government will engage with Mayoral Strategic Authorities to co -develop a new offer, including considering how this could work in place of existing grant. To drive growth and give local leaders the tools they need to deliver their vision, the government is developing a business rates retention zone offer with standardised criteria at MSA level. The government has already had early discussions with the mayors of South Yorkshire, the West of England and the North East to explore options for business rates retention zones to support local growth plans, and is open to discussions with other areas. The government will extend the 100% business rates retention pilots in Cornwall, the West of England, and Liverpool City Region for a further three years, to 2028-29. This will support local growth by allowing areas to continue retaining the benefits of business growth, while the government develops new retention arrangements for Mayoral Strategic Authorities. The government is reforming central government structures to put place at the heart of decision-making. This includes changes to the Green Book and the government has announced early adopters of place-based business cases in Liverpool, Plymouth, Port Talbot and Birmingham. [footnote 169] The National Wealth Fund has transformed its support offer to local authorities by establishing a new regional project accelerator (RPA). The RPA will focus on long-term and deeper strategic partnerships with high growth Mayoral Strategic Authorities and city regions, as well as support for complex flagship projects across the country. In addition, the government has launched an initiative to accelerate the delivery of priority projects in Greater Manchester, West Midlands, West Yorkshire and Glasgow City Region, with support from across public investment institutions. ## Supporting every region to prosper The government is tailoring investment to support higher growth in all regions, guided by its modern Industrial Strategy. The government has allocated funding, subject to final business cases, from the Growth Mission Fund for: \u00a316 million for the construction of a STEM centre in Darlington, \u00a320 million for redevelopment of the Inchgreen dry docks in Inverclyde, \u00a320 million for redevelopment of Kirkcaldy town centre"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "and seafront, and \u00a320 million to construct a sports quarter in Peterborough. The Budget builds on existing commitments to boost growth and create a secure future for all nations of the UK. The government is investing up to \u00a314.5 million in Grangemouth, Scotland, to support industrial projects; pioneering the UK's first small modular reactors in Anglesey in North Wales; and announcing \u00a316.6 million of new funding over the next three years to help businesses navigate the Windsor Framework and take full advantage of access to UK and EU markets. The government is committing \u00a34.2 million for the remediation of brownfield land in Port Talbot supporting the Harbourside Innovation District, aligned to the Celtic Freeport, helping to unlock further investment, subject to business case. The government is attracting new investment, including through the new \u00a330 million Kernow Industrial Growth Fund to invest in Cornwall's comparative sectoral advantages, including critical minerals, renewable energy and marine innovation, subject to a full business case. The government is committed to the success of Derby and the wider East Midlands. The government has made this clear through major transport and local growth funding, investing \u00a32 billion through Transport for City Regions and over \u00a3100 million through the Local Growth Fund, alongside the decision to place Great British Railway's headquarters in Derby, and investment in the next generation of nuclear technology with Rolls-Royce. The government will build on this progress by backing the Team Derby initiative, working in partnership to maximise the ongoing government investment in Derby. The government welcomes confirmation that London will deliver the DLR extension to Thamesmead, funded through Transport for London (TfL) and Greater London Authority (GLA) borrowing. The majority of the costs will be met by TFL and GLA, with the government also contributing over the long term. The government will continue to work with London to finalise funding details and will continue to work with the GLA to look at options for innovative financing to support the delivery of infrastructure projects in the capital. The Lower Thames Crossing is the largest roadbuilding project for a generation, and a key driver of growth, improving links between the Midlands, the North and key ports in the South East, as well as improving the resilience of the overall road network. The government has committed a further \u00a3891 million to complete the publicly-funded works for the Lower Thames Crossing, the final tranche of government support to enable the private sector to take forward construction and long-term operation. The government's preferred financing option at this stage is the Regulated Asset Base (RAB) model. The project will be taken forward on that basis, with formal market engagement launching in 2026. Alongside the new Northern Growth Corridor (see Box 3.C below), the government is accelerating progress on the Oxford to Cambridge Growth Corridor. In October, the government announced over \u00a3500 million of support for the region to unlock growth and accelerate opportunities, alongside a \u00a310 billion private sector investment by the Ellison Institute of Technology at its Oxford"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "site. [footnote 170] This, alongside East West Rail, new reservoirs and the first AI Growth Zone, will help drive the Corridor to reach its true potential. The government has also identified Tempsford in the Oxford to Cambridge Growth Corridor as a promising site for one of at least three new towns (alongside Leeds South Bank and Crews Hill) to unlock economic growth and accelerate housing delivery. ## Box 3.C: The Northern Growth Corridor and wider North - Major investments in Northern city regions via the Transport for City Regions Fund, the Local Innovation Partnership Fund and the series of commitments announced at the Regional Investment Summit, underline the government's commitment to driving growth in the North as a major element of its overall growth mission. - The government has appointed Tom Riordan as its envoy for the Northern Growth Corridor and will set out an overarching plan for the Corridor in early 2026. Developing and delivering this plan will be done in partnership with local leaders, universities and Northern businesses and will build on the huge assets in the corridor and wider North, to grow the economy, attract inward investment and create a complementary economic hub to London and the South East. Regeneration and housing - Northern cities have significant untapped potential. Through regeneration, the government is supporting local leaders in the North to create vibrant city centres where more people can live, work and enjoy their surroundings. Building on previous government commitments to West Yorkshire Mass Transit, support for the Northern Square Mile, and identification of Leeds South Bank as a promising site for a new town, the Budget is supporting West Yorkshire Combined Authority by establishing the Leeds City Fund as a 25-year business rates retention zone in Leeds, subject to business case. This will allow Leeds City Council to retain 100% of business rates growth above a baseline to invest in the city's transport network, unlock opportunities to build new homes and commercial spaces, and revitalise public spaces. ## Backing sector strengths - The Northern Growth Corridor aims to maximise potential across the modern Industrial Strategy's growth-driving sectors, and the government will work in partnership with mayors, investors and businesses to identify and unlock 'IS-8' investment opportunities. The government will make it quicker and easier for businesses to scale up and invest in the North. The government is also headquartering the new National Housing Bank in Leeds, as part of a cluster of financial institutions in the city, alongside the National Wealth Fund, Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority. ## Delivering infrastructure - The government is committed to improving infrastructure and rail connectivity across the North of England, including through the \u00a311 billion Transpennine Route Upgrade currently being delivered. City Region Sustainable Transport Settlements (CRSTS) are already delivering transformational benefits to local transport in major cities, and the further \u00a315.6 billion committed via the Transport for City Regions Fund will allow places to continue this work.

Source: National Wealth Fund announced deals. ## Box 3.D: Delivery case study on National Wealth Fund investment in Cumbria, Cornwall and Scotland: The new National Wealth Fund is at the forefront of investing public money in the UK's future, mobilising over \u00a370 billion in private investment for growth and clean energy, unlocking projects that otherwise would not have gone ahead. It has a total of \u00a327.8 billion in public capital available to invest in a range of capital-intensive projects, businesses and assets, prioritising the clean energy, advanced manufacturing, digital and technology, and transport sectors, and will support the delivery of the wider modern Industrial Strategy, including in defence, life sciences, and creative industries. From tin mining in Cornwall, to the UK's largest energy storage facility in Doncaster, and critical grid upgrades in Scotland, the National Wealth Fund is investing for growth across the length and breadth of the UK. Since its launch in October 2024, the National Wealth Fund has invested \u00a33.8 billion over 28 projects across the UK, mobilising \u00a35.3 billion in private investment, created or supported 20,300 jobs, and completed 27 local authority advisory engagements. [footnote 171] , [footnote 172] The National Wealth Fund portfolio will continue to expand through further impactful investments in the coming months. For instance, earlier this year, the National Wealth Fund completed a \u00a3600 million loan to support Scottish Power with seven of their priority transmission grid upgrade projects, unlocking hundreds of jobs. This was part of a wider \u00a31.35 billion public/private financing package. These critical grid upgrades will facilitate more renewable energy coming onto the system, reduce constraint costs, and lower the cost of electricity for businesses and consumers across the UK. [footnote 173] In August this year, the National Wealth Fund announced a \u00a3300 million Credit Enhancement Guarantee for Cascade Infrastructure Ltd which will design, build, finance and maintain the replacement of six tunnel sections of the Haweswater Aqueduct. This \u00a3300 million guarantee will help secure clean water from the Lake District to millions of residents in Cumbria, Lancashire and Greater Manchester for generations to come. Starting its main construction work next year, this project will create and support approximately 1,200 jobs in the local area. [footnote 174] Elsewhere, in Cornwall, the National Wealth Fund made a \u00a328.6 million equity investment into Cornish Metals Inc, to help finance the re-opening of South Crofty tin mine, creating more than 300 local jobs. [footnote 175] Aligning with its objective to support the government's growth mission, the National Wealth Fund's investment also supports the local enterprise plan to leverage access to critical minerals as a priority.

The government is taking significant steps to deliver on its modern Industrial Strategy commitments to reduce electricity prices for business, bringing them more in line with other major economies in Europe. The British Industry Supercharger cuts electricity costs for around 550 energy intensive businesses, and the government recently confirmed an uplift in relief through its Network Charging Compensation Scheme from 60% to 90%. [footnote 176] From 2027, the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will reduce electricity costs by c.\u00a33540/MWh and support thousands of businesses. In line with our modern Industrial Strategy, the scheme will benefit manufacturing, electricity intensive frontier industries, such as automotive and aerospace, and foundational manufacturing industries in their supply chains, such as chemicals. The Department for Business and Trade launched a consultation in November to determine design and eligibility for the scheme. [footnote 177] Nuclear power is central to the UK's energy security and delivering good jobs across the UK, but for too long decisions have been delayed, plans cancelled, and progress stalled. The government is taking a different approach, backing investment, unlocking innovation and removing the regulatory barriers that have slowed development and deployment. Earlier this month, the government announced that Wylfa in Anglesey, North Wales, will host the UK's first small modular reactor project, supporting up to 3,000 new jobs in the region. [footnote 178] The government will also continue to identify potential sites for large-scale nuclear power. This builds on the modern Industrial Strategy and significant funding commitments at the Spending Review, including for Sizewell C, which reached financial close in November allowing fullscale construction to begin, and innovative nuclear fusion research. [footnote 179] At the Budget, the government is going further to make nuclear power cheaper and to accelerate its deployment. The Prime Minister set up a Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce in February to propose radical reforms and to treat this as a once in a generation opportunity to regulate nuclear in a way that promotes better delivery without compromising safety. The Prime Minister is today issuing a Strategic Steer, which sets clear expectations for the civil, defence, and decommissioning nuclear sectors to accelerate safe and efficient delivery through proportionate regulation and stronger collaboration. This work is a clear demonstration of the government's commitment to overhaul the regulatory landscape so that it better supports growth and investment, as set out in March's Regulation Action Plan. The recently published report from John Fingleton and his team is a critical step forward. It sets out a comprehensive analysis of the regulatory challenges and opportunities for the sector. The government warmly welcomes"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "it and endorses its approach, and accepts the principle of all the recommendations it has set out. These recommendations will radically move the dial on the regulatory regime for civil and defence nuclear in this country. The government will present a full implementation plan within three months, taking account of our international obligations, national security considerations, and planning, environmental and court processes. The Taskforce will be engaged in the implementation phase to review progress and support delivery. The government will complete implementation within two years, subject to legislative timelines on elements requiring primary legislation. Building on the modern Industrial Strategy commitment to continue to increase collaboration and alignment between civil and defence nuclear, the government is also taking steps to align regulatory structures and incentives, including exploring the consolidation of defence and civil nuclear regulatory functions, providing this is compatible with national security imperatives. The government will also legislate to give the Office of Nuclear Regulation the ability to consider overall strategic factors such as energy and national security imperatives in the delivery of its statutory purposes. The government will monitor implementation of these recommendations and will, where applicable, look to apply similar approaches to other sectors to drive growth, looking in particular to the frontier industries identified in the Industrial Strategy, for example AI-related infrastructure. In addition, the government is setting out pathways for investment in the nuclear sector. The government has updated the Green Financing Framework to add nuclear energy for power generation to the list of policies eligible to be funded by green gilts and retail Green Savings Bonds. This demonstrates the government's conviction that nuclear energy is green and will enable investors to continue financing the UK's net zero objective. The inclusion of nuclear spending is subject to strict criteria and the updated Framework has received an improved rating by an external rating provider. However, connections to the grid remain one of the biggest blockers in delivering key growth projects across the economy. The government, alongside NESO and Ofgem, is therefore going further to overhaul connection processes by: - Applying new powers being sought in the Planning and Infrastructure Bill to create mechanisms to reallocate released capacity and reserve future capacity for strategically important demand projects. - Working with Ofgem to explore enhanced entry and membership requirements to ensure viable projects progress in the demand queue. - Reducing the time to power by exploring self-build for high voltage grid infrastructure and more flexible connections where possible. - Removing speculative demand in the grid connection queue. The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) will set out a strategic plan for data centres to ensure only the most strategic and credible projects are taken ## forward. The government is providing long-term fiscal and regulatory certainty to the oil and gas sector and its investors by confirming the details of a permanent mechanism to respond to oil and gas price shocks when the Energy Profits Levy (EPL) ends. The government has also published the North Sea Future Plan."}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "The Plan sets out the action the government is taking to support ongoing investment and opportunities in oil and gas, ensuring a fair, orderly and prosperous transition in the North Sea. The government is delivering on its commitments to cease issuing new oil and gas licences to explore new fields, while ensuring existing fields can be managed for their full lifespan, including by introducing Transitional Energy Certificates. The Plan establishes a new North Sea Jobs Service, offering tailored end -to -end support for the current workforce. A new Oil and Gas Price Mechanism (OGPM) will act as a windfall tax to deliver a fair return to the nation when oil and gas prices are unusually high. The mechanism will be revenue-based and apply an additional tax rate of 35% above price thresholds of $90/barrel for oil and 90p/therm for gas. Current price forecasts suggest that oil and gas prices are expected to be close to triggering the Energy Security Investment Mechanism (ESIM) price floor within the next few years. If average oil and gas prices fall under the ESIM thresholds, the Energy Profits Levy (EPL) will end immediately and the new OGPM will come into effect, returning the tax rate to the 40% headline rate in the permanent regime, with the OGPM only applying when prices are unusually high. If the ESIM is not triggered, the EPL will end by March 2030 and will be replaced by the OGPM. To provide certainty and ensure readiness should prices fall and the EPL end earlier, the government intends to legislate for the OGPM in the next Finance Bill (2026-27). The government will commence engagement immediately after the Budget on the draft legislation and implementation, to ensure the regime is ready to operate if required, and to consider the potential impacts of an early end to the EPL due to falling prices. These measures will support growth, oil and gas workers, supply chains and communities, recognising the important role that oil and gas will continue to play in the UK's energy mix for decades to come. The government recognises that refineries play a role in energy security and the UK's industrial base, and will publish a call for evidence on the fuel sector. The government is also considering the feasibility and impacts of including refined products in the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in future. ## 4.3 Backing Business and Unlocking Innovation The UK's ambitious researchers, innovators and entrepreneurs are a driving force of economic growth and job creation across the UK. Building on the UK's world-leading innovation ecosystem and entrepreneurial spirit, the government is taking action to ensure that businesses have the support, investment, and incentives they need to innovate, scale up, and succeed globally. This ambition is central to the UK's modern Industrial Strategy which sets out a 10-year plan to make the UK the best country to invest anywhere in the world, making it cheaper, easier and quicker to do business.

Over the last quarter (July -September), more than \u00a3250 billion worth of investment commitments into the IS-8 have been secured, supporting 45,000 jobs. [footnote 181] Recent examples of progress made in these sectors include: - Advanced Manufacturing: Launching DRIVE35 - a programme of capital and R&amp;D funding for the automotive industry - with \u00a32 billion of funding to 2030, alongside an additional \u00a3500 million for R&amp;D from 2030 to 2035. At the Budget, the government is extending the full programme to 2035 with an additional \u00a31.5 billion, providing \u00a34 billion of capital and R&amp;D funding to the automotive sector to support investment in zero emission technology. - Clean Energy Industries: Confirming Wylfa in North Wales as the site for the country's first small modular nuclear reactors, supporting up to 3,000 jobs, boosting clean energy and energy security. The government has also published its Clean Energy Jobs Plan, setting out how a new generation of good jobs will be created to deliver energy security. [footnote 182] - Creative Industries: Confirming allocation of \u00a3150 million Creative Places Growth Fund for West Midlands, West of England, West Yorkshire, North East, Liverpool City Region and Greater Manchester, with \u00a325 million going to each Mayoral Strategic Authority. - Defence: Signing a major frigate deal with Norway worth \u00a310 billion supporting over 4,000 UK jobs, including 2,000 in Scotland, delivering a - transformative boost to Glasgow and its shipbuilding sector, and supporting 432 businesses in the supply chain. - Digital and Technologies: Confirming three more AI Growth Zones in the North East, North Wales, and South Wales, alongside reforms to planning and energy to accelerate the building of AI infrastructure across the UK. - Financial Services: Launching the Office for Investment: Financial Services, a dedicated concierge service for international financial services firms seeking to establish or grow their presence within the UK, providing regulatory assistance and wider business support. - Life Sciences: Confirming \u00a330 million of government funding to create a new facility based in Darlington to accelerate the development of novel RNA therapies from labs to market, including to help tackle cancer, heart conditions and infectious diseases. - Professional and Business Services: Developing the Made Smarter Professional Business Services delivery model with Mayoral Strategic Authorities for 2026 rollout. The modern Industrial Strategy has guided decisions to prioritise the skills and workers needed in the UK's growth-driving sectors across all stages of the skills offer. The government is delivering ambitious targeted packages in engineering worth \u00a3182 million across four years, a \u00a3182 million package to boost the talent pipeline for the defence industry and \u00a3187 million for our Techfirst digital skills package. This is supported by the introduction of short courses through the Growth and Skills Levy in areas such as"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "digital and engineering, and Technical Excellence Colleges in advanced manufacturing, clean energy, digital and technologies and defence, delivering more opportunities to learn and earn in our priority sectors. The modern Industrial Strategy continues to shape the government's decisions in the Budget with announcements to accelerate innovation and drive growth in IS8 sectors, including increasing R&amp;D funding and maximising its impact by focusing UKRI's investment portfolio on the IS-8 growth sectors, extending DRIVE35 to 2035, supporting investment in zero-emission vehicle technology, and announcements on semiconductor and novel compute technologies. The Budget includes interventions to grow the IS-8 sectors across cities and clusters throughout the UK, boosting the Northern Growth Corridor, building on the momentum of the Oxford to Cambridge Growth Corridor, and delivering across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland's growth sectors. The government is going further and faster to reform our approach to procurement so that it can shape markets and manage demand. The government is putting in place measures to identify, nurture and protect the UK's high-growth modern Industrial Strategy sectors like AI, and the foundational sectors that support them, like steel, when procuring from the private sector. The government is also extending this approach to shipbuilding and maritime technology, as part of the Action Plan for Shipbuilding and Maritime Technology due Spring 2026. Together, these actions will strengthen security and economic resilience, whilst helping to drive growth and boost jobs, skills and innovation here in the United Kingdom. ## Entrepreneurship and innovation The UK is the best place in Europe to start a company, but unless more of these companies scale and stay here, the growth benefits will not be fully captured in the UK. Across the UK there is no shortage of ideas or talent. The ScaleUp Institute estimate that scaling firms make up 0.8% of all businesses, yet represent over half of all SME output. The government has published the 'Entrepreneurship in the UK' prospectus alongside the Budget, which sets out the reasons to start, scale and stay in the UK and the action government is taking. [footnote 183] , [footnote 184] Research and development (R&amp;D) drives economic growth, with each \u00a31 of public R&amp;D investment returning \u00a38 of economic benefits. [footnote 185] That is why annual government investment in R&amp;D will grow to \u00a322.6 billion by 2029-30 and will be focused on government priorities, with UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) directing \u00a39 billion over four years to IS-8 sectors, including \u00a34.5 billion for innovative UK companies in those sectors. As a first step, Innovate UK will launch a new Growth Catalyst programme worth \u00a3130 million, offering grants and tailored support to frontier companies that have already attracted investment. UKRI's \u00a3500 million R&amp;D Missions Accelerator programme will launch challenges to drive economic benefit from the UK's cultural assets and to cut construction costs for public infrastructure by 10%. UKRI will invest \u00a34 million per year for new Enterprise Fellowships, bringing 100 top researchers into business across the UK, and up to \u00a325 million for new entrepreneurship-focused doctoral"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "training schemes, and will launch a new \u00a34.5 million round of the Women in Innovation Awards. Restoring the balance between the rate that male and female entrepreneurs start and scale businesses could add up to \u00a3250 billion to the UK economy. [footnote 186] To support the economic contribution of the UK's universities, UKRI's investment in core quality-related block grant and Higher Education Innovation Funding will be protected in real terms over the Spending Review period, a cumulative increase of over \u00a3425 million. The government will support researchers by applying powerful scientific methods to science policy itself. The government will more than treble its investment in metascience in 2026-27, including in the UK's world-leading Metascience Unit, and it will expand distributed peer review across each of UKRI's research councils. This has shown potential to halve the time researchers wait for funding decisions. To supercharge researchers' productivity, the government has launched an ambitious AI for Science Strategy, backed by \u00a3137 million of investment over the next four years. [footnote 187] The government will leverage its procurement budgets to drive innovation. Each department will appoint a senior Procurement Innovation Champion, responsible for defining and delivering its innovation priorities through procurement. To accelerate access for strategically important innovative firms, the government will launch an Innovation Marketplace and establish a task-and-finish group to remove internal barriers to innovative procurement. Demonstrating a new approach, the government has launched an advance market commitment (AMC) to spur investment in clean concrete technologies, backed by Scottish Water, Ramboll, Derwent London, Atkins Realis UK, and Heathrow. Subject to due diligence, the government will launch another AMC, worth up to \u00a3100 million, for novel AI inference chips. Tax incentives for young, innovative companies have been very successful at supporting start-ups, but the existing limits in some schemes restrict their availability to companies in the critical scale-up phase. The government is therefore announcing a package of tax changes to support scaling companies to attract investment and talent. The government is significantly increasing the company eligibility limits for the Enterprise Management Incentives scheme (EMI) to allow scale-ups to join startups in offering tax-advantaged shares to the talent they need to grow. The government is also increasing the Venture Capital Trust (VCT) and Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) limits to allow investors to follow-on as companies grow beyond the start-up phase. To better balance the amount of upfront tax relief offered by VCTs compared to the EIS and incentivise funds to support highgrowth companies, the government is reducing the upfront VCT Income Tax relief from 30% to 20%. This sits alongside the government's previous announcement to allow companies to update existing EMI and Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) contracts so that employees can exercise their options at a PISCES trading event and retain access to the tax advantages. This represents a key step in the successful launch of PISCES, and will support scaling companies to achieve liquidity, and allow their employees to more easily reap the benefits of EMI and ## CSOP. The government will"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "take further steps to ensure tax support is founder-friendly. A call for evidence has been published, seeking input from across the scale-up and investor community on the impact of existing schemes and options to provide further support to ensure the UK entrepreneurial ecosystem thrives. [footnote 188] The UK's public finance institutions are also supporting entrepreneurship and innovation. The British Business Bank's (BBB) new Five-Year Strategic Plan is a step -change in how it will support small businesses, including scaling companies, using its increased permanent financial capacity of \u00a325.6 billion. [footnote 189] The BBB will invest at least \u00a35 billion in growth-stage funds and scale-up companies. The government has also asked the BBB to explore using its existing financial guarantee capacity to support IP-backed lending. The BBB has announced it intends to launch a VentureLink initiative for pension funds. This will see the BBB publish enhanced information on its commitments to venture funds, as part of a package of measures to help pension funds boost their investment capability, reduce barriers to investment and unlock billions more in long-term investment for UK science, technology and innovation. The government and City of London Corporation are also working with the Sterling 20 - a new investor-led partnership between 20 of the UK's largest pension funds and insurers - to channel the nation's savings into key infrastructure projects and IS-8 sectors. [footnote 190] This complements action the government is taking through the Pensions Schemes Bill to support pension savers and boost growth. At the Budget, the government is building on reforms to unlock some of the \u00a3160 billion of defined benefit pension scheme surplus by reducing the tax charge on surplus funds paid directly to members. This will make it easier for members to benefit and for trustees and employers to agree surplus extraction, boosting investment across the economy. The government is building on its ambitious programme of regulatory reforms and recent positive momentum to ensure UK capital markets competitiveness, and that they support firms to raise the capital they need to grow and invest. This includes introducing the new UK Listing Relief, a three-year exemption from Stamp Duty Reserve Tax for companies listing in the UK. While recognising the need to maintain responsible fiscal policy, the government will continue to evaluate Stamp Taxes on Shares to ensure the UK is positioned well for the future, and best supporting the competitiveness of our world-leading capital markets. Additionally, the government is delivering reforms to Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) as part of its wider strategy to develop a retail investment culture. This will drive better returns for savers and incentivise investment. Investing \u00a31,000 a year in an average stocks and shares ISA every year since 1999 would have delivered a \u00a350,000 better return than if it was invested in a cash ISA. [footnote 191] Financial services firms will also provide new, easily-navigable ways for people to find the right UK investment for them. Taken together, these measures will support companies to start, scale and list in the"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "UK. The UK's modern Industrial Strategy recognises the vast potential of AI to drive economic growth, innovation, and to improve lives. The UK AI sector alone has grown to more than 5,800 companies, an 85% increase over the past 2 years. [footnote 192] The government is making strong progress in delivering the AI Opportunities Action Plan, with four AI Growth Zones announced this year. The government has set out a package of measures to accelerate grid connections, cut energy bills and ease planning to keep the UK competitive, and accelerate the delivery of AI Growth Zones across the country. [footnote 193] AI Champions will drive adoption of AI across the IS-8. Shaheen Sayed, Chief Commercial Officer of Reinvention Services, Accenture has been named as the champion for Professional Business Services, and Chris Dungey, Chief Technology Officer High Value Manufacturing, Catapult will be working with the Advanced Manufacturing sector. They join Lucy Yu, CEO and founder of the Centre for Net Zero, who was appointed AI champion for Clean Energy. The government is also expanding the BridgeAI adoption programme into all highgrowth modern Industrial Strategy sectors. Continued collaboration between the government and the private sector is essential for driving innovation. To drive productivity further, the government will require the use of electronic invoicing for all VAT invoices for business-tobusiness and business-to-government transactions from 2029, with a roadmap to be published at Budget 2026. The government will also work with Ofcom to support the availability and adoption of gigabit broadband solutions by business. ## Box 3.F: Delivery case study: investment in AI Infrastructure and Supercomputers To harness the full opportunities of AI, it is vital that the UK has the infrastructure that underpins it. To support this, the government has turbocharged investment into UK supercomputers to transform the national compute ecosystem. The government is investing up to \u00a32 billion between now and 2030 to build a modern public compute ecosystem, ensuring that this country's start-up and research and development communities have the access they need to cutting-edge public compute. [footnote 194] This includes over \u00a31 billion to expand the AI Research Resource (AIRR) programme 20 times by 2030, up to \u00a3750 million for a new national supercomputer service at the Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre (EPCC), which will come online in 2027, and an up to \u00a3100 million advance market commitment to purchase novel compute. The government is already crowding in tens of billions of private investment to deliver computing power through the AI Growth Zone Programme, helping to unlock the growth benefits of AI in every part of the country. In November 2025, the government announced a new, third AI Growth Zone in North Wales, creating 3,400 jobs in the local area, and a fourth AI Growth Zone in South Wales. [footnote 195] , [footnote 196] The delivery of AI Growth Zones has been complemented by the landmark UK-US Technology Prosperity Deal agreed in September, through which Microsoft, working with the UK-based Nscale, announced that it is building the UK's largest supercomputer,"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "as part of a \u00a322 billion investment in AI infrastructure in the country. [footnote 197] OpenAI, NVIDIA, and Nscale have together also launched Stargate UK, a major AI infrastructure programme aimed at strengthening the UK's sovereign compute capabilities, including through investment into Cobalt Park, part of this government's North East AI Growth Zone. [footnote 198] The government recognises that the current regulatory landscape is not supporting growth. DBT's 2024 Business Perceptions Survey reveals that almost half of businesses (47%) find that regulation is an obstacle to their success, up from 45% in 2022. [footnote 199] One of the clearest manifestations of this is the high associated costs for businesses arising from administrative activities like form-filling or disproportionate reporting requirements. [footnote 200] In October, the government announced that it will reduce the annual administrative burden of regulation by \u00a35.6 billion by the end of Parliament. [footnote 201] The government has already identified and announced \u00a31.5 billion in administrative savings which will contribute to the target, including: - Speeding up and streamlining the delivery of 1.5 million new homes in England and critical infrastructure through the flagship Planning and Infrastructure Bill, expected to deliver \u00a3272 million in administrative savings for businesses every year. - Streamlining corporate reporting requirements, which could save businesses around \u00a3230 million per year by ensuring that tens of thousands of businesses will no longer need to produce a strategic report and, for other companies, simplifying requirements for narrative reporting;.The Prudential Regulation Authority is significantly reforming the information it requires from financial services firms to ensure it is proportionate, and has already proposed or implemented cuts to existing requirements which will save businesses \u00a3100 million per year. [footnote 202] By taking action to improve regulator performance and simplify the regulator landscape, the government is better aligning regulator activity with the government's objective to enable economic growth. The government will go further by reforming the Growth Duty so that the legal framework is clearer, more focused and ensures regulators must consider and promote growth. The government is asking the Food Standards Agency (FSA) to streamline food standards and hygiene regulation for large and regulation-compliant supermarkets. The FSA will develop a consistent, national approach in England for the regulation of large food businesses. Using centralised data and streamlined processes, this reform will ensure the sector and consumers can benefit from modern, efficient and effective regulation which supports growth, reduces unnecessary burdens, and keeps consumers safe. The government is undertaking a once-in-a-generation programme of reform to modernise and simplify product safety regulation. In early 2026, the Office for Products and Public Safety will tackle the prevalence of unsafe products sold online and streamline the processes for enforcement. ## Chart 3.3: Key measures of regulatory burden from 2007-2024 Source: Department for Business and Trade, Business Perceptions Survey 2024. ## Box 3.G: Delivery case study: bridging the gap between regulation and innovation This government is backing business by removing the regulatory barriers to growth and challenging risk aversion in our regulatory system. For example,"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "the government is bridging the gap between regulation and innovation, including by consulting on establishing an AI Growth Lab - a pioneering cross-economy sandbox, enabling carefully supervised deployment of responsible AI applications that current regulation limits. The government is also going further to remove barriers to scaling-up commercial drone operations. For example, the Department for Transport and Civil Aviation Authority are accelerating market enabling mutual recognition of manufacturing requirements and are streamlining the approval process for low-risk specific category operations by automating the majority of the process. Through the Regulators' Pioneer Fund and AI Capability Fund, the Regulatory Innovation Office (RIO) is already backing pro-innovation regulators to experiment, to speed up processes with AI, and to collaborate with startups and innovative businesses at the scientific frontier, including: - In Space, a RIO supported sandbox is enabling safe testing of new mission types to help unlock a \u00a32.7 billion market by 2031. The space regulation GOV.UK pages, making it much easier for startups and new entrants to quickly find and understand exactly what regulatory steps they need to take to comply. - In Drones, RIO's work is keeping drones in the skies for longer to enable NHS blood deliveries to be cut down from over 30 minutes by van to just two minutes by drone. This is part of the government's push to remove barriers to scaling up drone operations and ensuring that the UK is recognised by investors as a hub for commercial drone operations. - In AI in Health, backed by RIO funding, the MHRA is piloting AI assisted tools to support experts in scientific advice, clinical trial assessments, and licensing to improve efficiency and consistency, while keeping all decisions in human hands. In addition to reducing regulatory burdens on business, the government remains committed to simplifying the tax and customs system, saving businesses valuable time and money so that they can focus on growing and investing. As set out in the 'Backing your business' plan, the government is supporting small businesses by reducing the burdens they face, creating a level playing field and delivering the modern, digital services they expect. [footnote 203] At the Budget, the government is announcing reforms to simplify reporting requirements and improve HMRC services, and will set out further reforms to streamline processes and improve the taxpayer experience in spring 2026. These reforms build on HMRC's Transformation Roadmap, which outlines the government's vision for a more efficient, modernised and automated tax and customs system, including an ambition for at least 90% of HMRC customer interactions to be digital by 2030. [footnote 204] Around 80% of customer interactions are now digital, up from 73.2% in 2023-24. [footnote 205] , [footnote 206] To support inward investment, the Budget confirms a new service to provide major investment projects with advance tax certainty, committed to in the Corporate Tax Roadmap. It will be launched in July 2026. Details of the service are set out in a summary of responses to consultation, with technical guidance released shortly. The government"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "is taking action and responding to key industry asks across the hospitality and retail sectors. - The government has heard from hospitality businesses that disproportionate licensing conditions can stifle their growth and reduce options for consumers. The government is therefore asking licensing authorities in England and Wales to explicitly consider the need to promote growth and deliver economic benefits in their decisions and setting this out in the first National Licensing Policy Framework, to be published at Budget. - Building on the success of the licensing taskforce, the government will explore further planning reforms to make it easier for hospitality and high street businesses to expand and grow. - The government will continue to make improvements to the packaging Extended Producer Responsibility (pEPR) including consulting in early 2026 on proposals to measure the performance and effectiveness of local authorities' use of pEPR fees and appointing a Producer Responsibility Organisation by March 2026 to give industry a central role in operating the scheme. The government will also consult on reforms to the Packaging Waste Recycling Note system. The reforms set out above will not be delivered overnight and will require close collaboration with industry. The government will appoint a new Retail and Hospitality Envoy to help deliver them and champion these businesses within government. To support fair competition between high street businesses and online retailers following the recent rapid growth in low value imports, the government will remove the customs duty relief for low value imports - goods valued at \u00a3135 or less - and reform the way these goods are declared into the UK. From March 2029 at the latest, low value imports will be charged customs duty just as goods imported in bulk already are and new import arrangements will be put in place. The government will consult on the technical detail of these new arrangements. The UK is not alone in reforming its approach to low value imports, with our international partners, including the US and EU, taking similar steps to ensure fairer tariff treatment and appropriate control of booming low value trade. ## Box 3.H: Business rates The government is delivering on its commitment to rebalance the business rates system in England by introducing permanently lower tax rates for retail, hospitality and leisure (RHL) properties, worth nearly \u00a3900 million a year. Today, the government has announced the rates for the permanently lower RHL business rates multipliers, which will benefit over 750,000 RHL properties, including the shops and pubs that make up the backbone of the high street. [footnote 207] The RHL multipliers will be 5p below their national equivalents, making the small business RHL multiplier 38.2p and the standard RHL multiplier 43p in 2026-27. Small and standard RHL properties will pay the lowest tax rate since 1990-91 and 2010-11 respectively. [footnote 208] To fund this sustainably, the government is introducing a higher rate on the most valuable properties - those with rateable values of \u00a3500,000 and above, representing around 1% of properties. [footnote 209] The government has"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "the legislative flexibility to set the higher rate up to 10p higher than the national standard multiplier. However, this higher rate is being set at only 2.8p above the national standard multiplier in recognition of the important role these properties play in the government's growth mission. The highvalue multiplier will be 50.8p in 2026-27. Business rates revaluations ensure that the rateable values (the tax base) of properties remain in line with market changes, and that the tax rates adjust to reflect changes in the tax base. Following the revaluation, all ratepayers will pay a lower tax rate than they do now, with the small business multiplier falling to 43.2p and the standard multiplier 48p. At this revaluation, over half of ratepayers will see no bill increases, including 23% seeing their bills go down. For those seeing bill increases, reflecting many sectors' post-Covid recovery, the government is providing a support package worth \u00a34.3 billion over the next 3 years, including: - A \u00a33.2 billion Transitional Relief scheme providing more generous support to the largest ratepayers, including airports and hospitality. - A Supporting Small Business scheme to help the smallest businesses worth over \u00a3500 million. - Expanding the Supporting Small Business scheme to businesses who were eligible for RHL relief, protecting independent pubs and shops as they transition to permanently lower tax rates. This additional support is worth \u00a31.3 billion. The government is also taking the next steps to reform business rates, building on the interim report published in September. The government is supporting businesses to expand and grow by providing an additional two years of Small Business Rates Relief for businesses expanding into a second property, and continuing work to transform business rates by publishing a call for evidence exploring how to tackle barriers to investment. The call for evidence also explores concerns a small number of ratepayers have raised around the 'Receipts &amp; Expenditure' valuation methodology and its impacts on long-term, high value investments. The government is clamping down on illegal high street activity in premises like mini-marts, barbershops, vape shops, nail bars and car washes. These activities can be used to make the proceeds of crime appear legitimate, while being used to sell illicit products and evade tax. The government's 2025 National Risk Assessment for anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing found that the risk of cash-based money laundering remains high in the UK, with an estimated \u00a312 billion of criminal cash generated in the UK each year. [footnote 210] Under this government, there has already been a significant crackdown on illegal working, raising enforcement activity to the highest levels in recorded history. In the year ending September 2025, 11,000 raids were carried out by Immigration Enforcement; and by June 2025, over 2,100 civil penalties were issued to employers found to have hired illegal workers totalling over \u00a3117 million. [footnote 211] In the Budget, the government is supporting stronger and more joined-up enforcement action against those who break the rules including through: - Establishing a dedicated cross-government taskforce to"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "develop an intelligence-led understanding of organised crime on our high streets, design systemic interventions to disrupt money laundering and related criminality, and set strategic priorities for future operational activity. - Providing additional funding to enhance Trading Standards capabilities and fund an uplift of at least 45 additional law enforcement officers. This will support further action against organised criminality on our high streets, boosting efforts to protect communities and support legitimate businesses. - Directing up to \u00a310 million in funding from HMRC to Border Force in 2026 -27 to enhance operational information gathering capabilities ahead of the introduction of the Vaping Product Duty on 1 October 2026 and to support enforcement at the border. - Undertaking additional enforcement activity on high streets, focusing on illicit tobacco and vaping products and more targeted criminal interventions to tackle the most serious fraud and evasion by small businesses, by deploying 350 newly recruited criminal investigators as part of a new team in HMRC's Fraud Investigation Service. - Providing further funding to tackle money laundering by increasing the Economic Crime Levy. This includes funding to boost law enforcement resource and technological capabilities, and for the public-private data-sharing and financial intelligence used to target criminal exploitation of high street businesses. The government is also clear that it must track the flow of cash through these businesses, to combat the illicit activities it funds. The government is developing an Anti-Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Strategy with the private sector to target criminal cash and recover proceeds. The government is taking action to tackle those who abuse insolvency processes to evade tax and write off their debts. The government will fund the recruitment of 50 additional insolvency service staff within a new Abusive Phoenixism Taskforce to disqualify more rogue directors and will amend the Company Directors Disqualification Act to extend the circumstances in which directors who break the law can be disqualified. The government is going after rogue retailers who breach tobacco and vape regulations, by taking the power in the Tobacco and Vapes Bill to introduce a licensing scheme for retailers to sell tobacco and vape products. This will strengthen enforcement and support legitimate businesses. The government is also legislating to introduce the Vaping Duty Stamps scheme from 1 October 2026, which requires all vaping products manufactured or imported into the UK to have a duty stamp on packaging so illicit products are immediately identifiable. The government will also clamp down on Electronic Sales Suppression, where businesses use illegitimate software to falsely remove sales from the audit trail to evade paying the tax they owe. The government will publish a call for evidence in 2026 to develop point of sale software standards to tackle the illegal use of transaction suppression software and improving HMRC's ability to detect, prevent and enforce against any misuse. As previously announced, the government is also working to extend right to work checks to cover businesses hiring gig economy and zero-hours workers. This will restrict the ability of rogue employers to take advantage"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "of illegal workers and ensure that legitimate businesses acting lawfully will not be undercut on labour costs by those who exploit the system. The government is also cracking down on employers that are not meeting their obligations to workers and undercutting legitimate businesses. The government will set up a dedicated 'hidden economy' team within the new Fair Work Agency from April 2026 to take action in sectors known to have egregious breaches of employment rights legislation alongside illegal working and tax issues. The team will initially target hand car washes but will then move onto other high -risk areas. The Fair Work Agency will work more closely with trade unions and local business groups, to gather on-the-ground intelligence about employers who are exploiting their workers. The government will explore how the Fair Work Agency can use powers in the Companies Directors Disqualification Act 1986 (CDDA) to disqualify directors whose abuse of workers' rights makes them unfit to be concerned in the management of a company, particularly where there are repeat breaches. If a worker complains to the Fair Work Agency, it will follow up with the employer concerned because everyone should have the confidence that the government will listen, and act. And the government will name employers who break the law more regularly. By summer 2026, the government will eliminate the backlog of cases that it inherited from the previous government, and, going forward, all employers who break the law will be named within a year of their case closing. Because people must have confidence that if you break the law, you will be caught and there will be consequences. ## 4.4 Unleashing talent and opportunity The government is committed to building a dynamic and inclusive labour market that supports economic growth across all parts of the UK. A thriving labour market is essential to ensure that businesses have access to the skills and talent they need, whilst enabling everyone to find good jobs and the opportunity to progress, wherever they choose to live. The government is supporting young people to earn or learn, and investing in government-funded childcare and breakfast clubs. At the Budget, the government is setting out the next steps to ensure that people and businesses across the country can seize the opportunities of the UK's modern Industrial Strategy. ## Chart 3.4: Active users of 30-hour childcare offer, April 2024 to current, against target Source: Department for Education's Eligibility Checking System. The government is investing to boost children's life chances and to increase work choices for parents through rollout of continued expansion of governmentfunded childcare for working parents. Over half a million children and parents are already benefitting from the government's rollout of funded childcare with strong take-up across the country - from over 78,000 children accessing places in the North West to almost 92,000 in the South East - helping families save up to \u00a37,500 a year per child and supporting parents in getting back to work. [footnote 212] , [footnote 213] The OBR estimates that"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "the successful rollout of this programme will enable around 60,000 people to enter employment, and around 1.5 million already in employment to increase their hours, thereby supporting families to be better off. [footnote 214] ## Box 3.I: Delivery case study: school-based nurseries The government is investing over \u00a38 billion in early years support in 202526. [footnote 215] Expanding childcare entitlements is enabling more parents, particularly mothers, to balance work and more children to access the highquality early education that improves outcomes and supports them to thrive. To help deliver these entitlements, the government is creating tens of thousands of places in new or expanded school-based nurseries, backed by over \u00a3400 million of investment. The first funding round created over 5,000 places. [footnote 216] The majority of school-based nurseries delivered in the first phase are in the North or Midlands, increasing access to childcare in areas where it is needed. For example, Bardsey Primary Academy in West Yorkshire has successfully expanded its nursery provision using the School-based Nursery Capital Grant. The project converted a former caretaker's bungalow into a dedicated early years space, creating 20 additional places for 2 and 3 yearolds. As set out at SR25, the government is making the biggest investment in employment support for disabled people and those with health conditions in at least a generation. Under the Pathways to Work Guarantee, anyone claiming out of work benefits who is disabled or has a health condition will have access to specialist work coaches and tailored support, including an expanded Connect to Work programme in England and Wales. The government is introducing new earned income disregards in Housing Benefit for claimants in supported housing and temporary accommodation. This will reduce the financial cliff edge when moving into, or progressing in, work, ensuring that work pays. The Post-16 Education and Skills White Paper, published in October 2025, sets out the government's vision for a world-leading skills system in England which breaks down barriers to opportunity; meets student and employer needs; widens access to high-quality education and training; supports innovation, research, and development; and improves people's lives. [footnote 217] The government is making more than \u00a31.5 billion available over the Spending Review period for investment in employment and skills support. This funds \u00a3820 million for the Youth Guarantee, which includes offering a guaranteed sixmonth paid work placement for every eligible 18-to 21 year old who has been on Universal Credit and looking for work for 18 months helping young people across Great Britain take that crucial first step into sustained employment. This also includes \u00a3725 million for the Growth and Skills Levy to help support apprenticeships for young people, including a change to fully fund SME apprenticeships for eligible people under 25. Alongside this funding, the government will introduce new reforms to simplify the apprenticeship system and make it more efficient as short courses are introduced from April 2026, including removing the additional uplift to levy accounts; changing the expiry window to 12 months; changing the government's co-investment rate to"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "75% for levy-paying employers once they have exhausted all their funds; and working with employers to streamline the suite of apprenticeship standards available. More details on the wider Youth Guarantee and Growth and Skills Levy package will be announced shortly. The UK's economic future relies on leading cutting-edge innovation in AI, life sciences, clean energy, advanced manufacturing and creative industries sectors prioritised for growth in the government's modern Industrial Strategy. The government is reforming the high-skill visa system, making it easier for the world's brightest and best to start, scale, and stay in the UK within a controlled migration system. In October 2025, the Home Office laid new Immigration Rules before Parliament, introducing pro-talent reforms to the High Potential Individual, Innovator Founder, and Global Talent visas. [footnote 218] Taking effect from November 2025, these changes streamline access to top-tier talent in support of the UK's modern Industrial Strategy. The High Potential Individual route will expand to graduates from the world's top 100 universities, while international students will be able to transition seamlessly from study to entrepreneurship through the Innovator Founder route. Updates to the Global Talent visa include reforms to make it simpler and easier for top science and design talent to access the visa and to expand the list of eligible prizes. [footnote 219] , [footnote 220] A new Global Talent Taskforce will also help attract leading professionals in priority sectors and provide tailored support for relocation. [footnote 221] The government's growth strategy is working. The progress made via ambitious reforms to date is clear: real wages are rising, and the UK is performing well against its peers, paving the way to sustained higher living standards and lower cost of living. The government is breaking down barriers to opportunity and delivering change to maximise the UK's full potential as a thriving global economy: investing for the future, backing businesses and unlocking innovation to unleash talent and opportunity. These are the right choices to secure sustained economic growth for the benefit of people across every nation and region of the UK. ## 5.

The OBR will continue to publish a second forecast in the spring to provide an interim update on the economy and public finances. ## 6. Financing This annex sets out the government's financing plans for 2025-26, which were previously revised on 23 April 2025. [footnote 222] Further details of the revised financing remit for 2025-26, including progress against the remit to date, can be found on the website of the UK Debt Management Office (DMO). [footnote 223] The government's debt management framework remains as set out in the Debt Management Report 2025-26. [footnote 224] ## 6.1 Debt management objective The debt management objective, as set out in the Debt Management Report 2025-26, is 'to minimise, over the long term, the costs of meeting the government's financing needs, taking into account risk, while ensuring that debt management policy is consistent with the aims of monetary policy.' ## 6.2 Debt management policy The government's decisions on the structure of the financing remit are made in accordance with the debt management objective, the debt management framework, and wider policy considerations. In determining the overall structure of the financing remit, the government assesses the costs and risks of debt issuance by maturity and type of instrument. Decisions on the composition of debt issuance are also informed by an assessment of investor demand for debt instruments by maturity and type, as well as the government's appetite for risk. Alongside these considerations, the government takes into account the practical implications of issuance (for example, the scheduling of operations throughout the year). While decisions on debt management policy must be taken with a long-term perspective, specific decisions on funding the government's gross financing requirement are taken annually. Those decisions are announced in advance of the forthcoming financial year and are typically updated in April (a technical adjustment to reflect outturn data from the previous year) and, as now, when the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) publishes subsequent fiscal projections. ## 6.3 Financing arithmetic The updated financing arithmetic for 2025-26 is set out in Table A.1. The OBR's November 2025 forecast for the 2025-26 central government net cash requirement (excluding NRAM Ltd, Bradford &amp; Bingley and Network Rail), which is referred to as CGNCR (ex NRAM Ltd, B&amp;B, and NR) is \u00a3149.2 billion. This represents an upward revision of \u00a36.5 billion since the forecast published at Spring Statement 2025. This measure is used in the financing arithmetic, as it reflects the forecast cash requirement of the Exchequer. The DMO's net financing requirement (NFR) for 2025-26 was revised up by \u00a34.9 billion on 23 April 2025, from \u00a3304.2 billion to \u00a3309.1 billion. The DMO's NFR is being revised up by a further"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "\u00a35.6 billion at the Budget 2025, to \u00a3314.7 billion. The NFR for the DMO comprises: CGNCR (ex NRAM Ltd, B&amp;B, and NR) plus any financing for gilt redemptions and other adjustments, less the net contribution to financing from National Savings and Investments (NS&amp;I), and any other in-year contributions to financing. The upward revision to the DMO's NFR will be delivered through i) an increase in gross gilt issuance this year of \u00a34.6 billion and ii) a \u00a31 billion increase in financing raised through the net issuance of Treasury bills for debt management purposes.

Total gilt sales in 2025-26 in comparison with the April remit revision are now forecast to rise by \u00a34.6 billion to \u00a3303.7 billion. The increase in gilt sales of \u00a34.6 billion will be implemented as follows: - An increase of \u00a315.6 billion in short-dated conventional gilts to \u00a3133.5 billion (44.0% of total issuance in 2025-26). - An increase of \u00a312.4 billion in medium-dated conventional gilts (including green gilts) to \u00a3102.1 billion (33.6% of total issuance in 2025-26). [footnote 225] - A decrease of \u00a31.1 billion in long-dated conventional gilts (including green gilts) to \u00a328.7 billion (9.5% of total issuance in 2025-26).4 - An increase of \u00a30.2 billion in index-linked gilts to \u00a331.1 billion (10.2% of total issuance in 2025-26). - A decrease of \u00a322.5 billion in the unallocated portion to \u00a38.3 billion (2.7% of total issuance in 2025-26). [footnote 226] Since April 2025, the unallocated portion had been drawn down to \u00a36.7 billion via transfers to the short, medium, and long conventional, as well as the index-linked, gilt sales programmes. Relative to just prior to this remit revision, the unallocated portion of gilt issuance is being increased from \u00a36.7 billion to \u00a38.3 billion. Auctions will remain the government's primary method of gilt issuance. It is anticipated that \u00a3231.9 billion (76.4%) of total gilt sales will take place via auction in 2025-26, and \u00a347.0 billion (15.5%) will be issued via syndication. The government will also continue to have the option to schedule gilt tenders, which may be used to assist with the delivery of the financing remit and may also be used for market management reasons. ## 6.5 Treasury bills It was previously planned that net Treasury bill issuance would make a \u00a310 billion contribution to meeting the 2025-26 NFR. Following revisions at the Budget, net issuance of Treasury bills will now contribute \u00a311 billion to the net financing requirement for 2025-26. The government is committed to maintaining as diversified an investor base as possible, to enhance the resilience of the government's financing programme. In keeping with this, HM Treasury and the DMO will launch a consultation in January 2026 on expanding and deepening the Treasury bill market. In accordance with the debt management objective, any changes following the consultation will take into account an assessment of cost and risk, including implications for the government's refinancing risk exposure. ## 6.6 Green gilts and green retail savings products The government continues to be committed to its Green Financing Programme, under which the UK issues sovereign green bonds ('green gilts') via the DMO, and retail Green Savings Bonds (GSBs) via NS&amp;I. As of 26 November 2025, the Green Financing Programme has raised more than \u00a351.0 billion for expenditures that tackle climate change, rebuild natural ecosystems and support jobs in green sectors. The government has updated the Green Financing Framework to add nuclear energy for power generation to the list of policies eligible to be funded by green gilts and GSBs. [footnote 227] This demonstrates the government's conviction that nuclear energy is green"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "and will enable investors to continue financing the UK's Net Zero objective. The inclusion of nuclear spending is subject to strict criteria. The proceeds from sales of green gilts and GSBs issued prior to 27 November 2025 will not be allocated to nuclear energy-related expenditures. A Second Party Opinion from S&amp;P rates the new Framework as dark green, their highest rating, and an improvement on the Framework's original rating in 2021. The government's plans to raise \u00a310.0 billion via issuance of green gilts in 2025 -26, subject to demand and market conditions, remain unchanged. Total green gilt proceeds in the financial year to-date are \u00a33.7 billion (cash). GSBs were brought on sale on 22 October 2021 and have allowed UK savers to support the government's green spending initiatives. As of November 2025, NS&amp;I forecasts it will have raised \u00a31.9 billion since the launch of GSBs. GSBs have been repriced several times in response to market developments and to meet the requirements of the Green Financing Programme. Issue 7 was launched in January 2024, with an interest rate of 2.95%. In October 2024 the first GSBs issued began to mature, with customers having the option to either reinvest in GSB (or another NS&amp;I product) or withdraw their investment. Over 2025-26, NS&amp;I forecasts \u00a374.6 million of inflows against \u00a3428 million of outflows, resulting in a net funding forecast of -\u00a3353 million. Financing raised through GSBs is monitored throughout the year to ensure the requirements of the Green Financing Programme can be met and that funds raised remain balanced against proceeds from green gilts. For 2025-26, an inflow cap of \u00a3100 million was put in place. Revisions to the cap are made to manage inflows into the Green Financing Portfolio and NS&amp;I's financing position. NS&amp;I expects additional inflows for 2025-26 to be below the upper limit of \u00a3100 million, subject to market conditions. ## 6.7 NS&amp;I NS&amp;I's net financing target in 2025-26 is being revised up by \u00a31 billion, to \u00a313 billion within a range of +/- \u00a34 billion. In meeting this revised target, NS&amp;I will continue to balance the interests of its savers, the taxpayer, and the wider financial services sector. The proceeds from the sale of the GSBs do not form part of NS&amp;I's annual net financing target, but they do contribute to the overall gross financing requirement and will be reported as part of the financing arithmetic before the financial year-end. Table A.2 sets out the illustrative gross financing requirement for each financial year from 2026-27 to 2030-31, using the OBR's November 2025 forecast for CGNCR (ex NRAM Ltd, B&amp;B, and NR) and taking into account current planned gilt redemptions.

Delivering in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland The Budget takes the fair and necessary choices to deliver on the government's promises of change for the people and businesses of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The government's steps to control spending and reform the tax system mean that we are taking decisive action to ease the cost of living and bring down inflation. These are important steps to support the people of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This includes delivering up to \u00a314.5 million to support industrial projects that can create new jobs in Scotland's Grangemouth, announcing that Anglesey in North Wales will pioneer the UK's first small modular reactors, and delivering \u00a316.6 million new funding to boost Northern Ireland trade. Spending Review 2025 provided devolved governments with their largest spending review settlements in real terms since devolution in 1998. [footnote 228] As a result of decisions at Budget 2025, the devolved governments will receive an additional \u00a31.7 billion through the operation of the Barnett formula on top of these record settlements. This comprises \u00a31.07 billion resource funding and \u00a3625 million capital funding: - The Scottish Government will receive an additional \u00a3510 million resource funding and \u00a3310 million capital funding. - The Welsh Government will receive an additional \u00a3320 million resource funding and \u00a3185 million capital funding. - The Northern Ireland Executive will receive an additional \u00a3240 million resource funding and \u00a3130 million capital funding. All devolved governments continue to receive over 20% more per person than equivalent government spending in the rest of the UK, and funding settlements are growing in real terms between 2024 -25 and 2028 -29. [footnote 229] ## 7.1 Support across the nations The government is taking action to ease the cost of living in all nations of the UK by: - Combatting child poverty by removing the two child limit in Universal Credit (UC) Child Element. This will support low-income families across Great Britain. 95,000 children in Scotland and 69,000 in Wales will benefit from this change. [footnote 230] The government will fund the Northern Ireland Executive to remove the two child limit for families in Northern Ireland should it choose to do so, as welfare is devolved. - Increasing the National Living Wage (NLW) and the National Minimum Wage (NMW).

[footnote 235] The government will work with the Northern Ireland Executive if they choose to develop a comparable offer. The government is also investing to deliver growth across the UK by: - Unblocking key growth projects across Scotland and Wales by overhauling the grid connection process, and rolling out the Connections Accelerator Service to support the most strategically important projects to find solutions to connection delays. - Launching entrepreneurship fellowships to support commercialisation in universities in the UK, including those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, supporting UK Research and Innovation's (UKRI) existing investments to fuel regional growth across the nations. - Confirming \u00a3783 million for a new local growth programme over three years to support regeneration across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This is a new fund, distinct from the UK Shared Prosperity Fund. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the Offices for the Nations will work with the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG), communities, local partners and others to implement this new local growth fund. It will support the government's focus on ensuring that growth and improvements in living standards are felt in every part of the UK. The government is supporting exports from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland through: - A new UK-EU Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement which will reduce export costs and deliver"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "less red tape for meat exporters in Scotland and Wales. This will support export of globally recognised products, including Scottish Angus beef and Welsh lamb. The agreement will also allow routine checks on animal and plant products moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland to be removed, strengthening Northern Ireland's place in the UK Internal Market. - The UK-India Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which is estimated to boost Scotland's economy by \u00a3190 million per year, Wales's economy by \u00a380 million every year and Northern Ireland's economy by \u00a350 million annually. [footnote 236] It benefits key industries across the nations, including Scottish salmon and - whisky, Welsh food and drink, and Northern Ireland's advanced manufacturing and technology sectors. - The UK, being the only country to have secured a preferential tariff rate for steel and aluminium exports, which is half that paid by all other exporters to the US, benefitting key steel sites including Liberty Steel in Glasgow, Tata Steel in Port Talbot, Llanwern and Trostre, as well as 7 Steel in Cardiff. The government is reforming the tax system in a fair and balanced way, including creating separate tax rates for property income. This will apply to England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The government will engage with the devolved governments of Scotland and Wales to provide them with the ability to set property income rates in line with their current income tax powers in their fiscal frameworks. ## 7.2 Scotland The Scottish economy is already worth \u00a3204 billion per year. [footnote 237] The government is investing in Scotland's economic potential and unique contributions to the UK at the Budget. The government is supporting Scotland's energy industry through the Budget by: - Giving the oil and gas sector and its investors long-term certainty on taxation by confirming the details of a permanent windfall tax mechanism, to replace the Energy Profits Levy (EPL) when it ends. The permanent windfall tax mechanism will deliver a fair return to the UK public when oil and gas prices are unusually high and will be revenue-based, with a rate of 35% and thresholds of $90/barrel for oil and 90p/therm for gas. This will help the sector plan for the future, supporting jobs and long-term investment. - Providing certainty on the oil and gas regulatory regime. Our North Sea Future Plan, published alongside the Budget, sets out the action the government is taking to support ongoing investment in oil and gas and the management of existing fields for the entirety of their lifespan. This will support oil and gas workers, supply chains, and communities, recognising the important role that oil and gas will continue to play in the UK's energy mix for decades to come. - Investing up to \u00a314.5 million of funding in Grangemouth to support industrial projects that can create new jobs, recognising Grangemouth's almost 250 -year history as a key UK industrial site. The government will collaborate with the Scottish Government to use this funding, which will work alongside the National Wealth Fund's (NWF)"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "\u00a3200 million commitment to support investment opportunities in Grangemouth. This follows the \u00a3100 million Falkirk and Grangemouth Growth Deal, delivered jointly with the Scottish Government, which will also support jobs, including through a Skills Transition Centre. This builds on the government's recent investment in Scotland's energy industry, including: - \u00a317.3 million further government funding to boost the Aberdeen Energy Transition Zone. - A \u00a362.1 million loan from the NWF for Orkney Islands Council's six-turbine wind farm at Quanterness. - Establishing a new government campus for energy in Aberdeen, including Great British Energy's headquarters, drawing on the city's world-leading engineering expertise. [footnote 238] Great British Energy - Nuclear will also assess potential nuclear sites in Scotland. At the Budget, the government is investing further to deliver growth in Scotland by: - Committing \u00a320 million from the government's Growth Mission Fund to upgrade Inchgreen Dry Dock, subject to business case. The government will collaborate with Inverclyde Council to breathe new life into the currently derelict dock, turning it back into one of the largest dry docks in Europe and creating new jobs for the local area. - Providing up to \u00a320 million from the Growth Mission Fund for the redevelopment of Kirkcaldy town centre and seafront, subject to final business case. - Approving the full business case for Forth Green Freeport, which aims to leverage \u00a37.9 billion of investment over 10 years and create up to 16,000 direct jobs. A Memorandum of Understanding can now be signed with the Scottish Government, enabling the release of \u00a325 million of government seed capital funding. Green energy and advanced manufacturing businesses located on the Freeport's tax sites will benefit from a range of tax reliefs and incentives. The Freeport will boost UK production of clean energy and sustainable fuels, including offshore wind energy. - Announcing \u00a31.5 million of funding for two Scottish automotive companies from the latest DRIVE35 programme funding round. This builds on investments that UK public finance institutions are delivering for Scotland's economy and businesses. This includes the British Business Bank's Investment Fund for Scotland, which has committed over \u00a325 million of funding to smaller businesses during its first 18 months, supporting firms across a range of sectors to thrive and grow. [footnote 239] Businesses across Scotland supported by the fund include: - Edinburgh-based Ingenza Ltd., a leading biotech research business, which has secured \u00a32 million funding to double its capacity, creating up to 20 new jobs. [footnote 240] - The Benbecula Distillery, which has secured a \u00a31.5 million investment. This marks the fund's first equity investment in the Highlands and Islands, with the funding set to enable the distillery to embark on a programme of growth, including creating new local jobs, expanding production, and supporting the whisky maturation process. - The Glasgow-based powerchair startup, Freedom One Life, has secured a \u00a3500,000 loan.

This follows the government's existing investments in Scotland's future, including: - Committing to locate an AI Growth Zone in Scotland. With Scotland being an area that generates more energy locally than the grid needs, an AI Growth Zone would be able to utilise this. - Up to \u00a3750 million committed at the Spending Review to build the UK's new national supercomputer at the University of Edinburgh, strengthening Britain's position as an AI-maker and research power, with researchers and start-ups backed to deliver new waves of innovations and discoveries. - A \u00a350 million award earmarked for the Glasgow City Region through the Local Innovation Partnership Fund. This will support spin-out and scaling of firms in innovation clusters in the region focused in areas such as, medicine, biotechnology and quantum computing. - The recent announcement of a new Defence Growth Deal being developed for Scotland, which will add to the 11,800 jobs already directly supported by the government's defence spending in Scotland. [footnote 241] The UK-wide support for exporters builds on the government's existing support for exporters in Scotland, including \u00a32.25 million in funding for Brand Scotland committed at Spending Review 2025. As well as directly delivering for Scotland, the government also funds the Scottish Government to deliver on its devolved priorities. Spending Review 2025 provided the Scottish Government with its largest spending review settlements in real terms since devolution in 1998. [footnote 242] As a result of decisions at Budget 2025, the Scottish Government will receive an additional \u00a3510 million resource funding and \u00a3310 million capital funding through the operation of the Barnett formula on top of these record settlements. This means the Scottish Government's settlement continues to grow in real terms between 2024 -25 and 2028 -29. The Scottish Government continues to receive at least 20% more per person than equivalent government spending in the rest of the UK. ## 7.3 Wales The government recognises Wales's proud industrial history and the potential of its advanced manufacturing and businesses for future UK growth. The Welsh economy is already worth \u00a393 billion per year. [footnote 243] The government is going further to support Wales's energy industry at the Budget by announcing that Anglesey in North Wales will pioneer the UK's first small modular reactors, recognising Wyfla's strong nuclear heritage. This is expected to support up to 3,000 jobs at peak construction and power the equivalent of around three million homes, equivalent to all of Wales's homes twice over. [footnote 244] , [footnote 245] The project was backed by over \u00a32.5 billion funding from the government at Spending Review 2025 - the most significant industrial investment in North Wales in a generation. [footnote 246] The government is investing to deliver growth in Wales at the Budget: - The government is establishing AI Growth Zones in North Wales and South Wales, each backed with \u00a35 million investment in local AI adoption and skills. This will establish North Wales as a leading location for AI development, and a total of 3,450 jobs are now"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "poised to come online as a direct result.

This funding will focus on semiconductor technologies critical to AI and - data centres to support innovation, strengthen supply chains, and develop the skills needed for future growth. - Welsh firms will be supported to scale and commercialise cutting-edge technologies and Welsh universities will benefit from the \u00a34 million per year that UKRI will invest in new fellowship funding to support budding academic entrepreneurs to develop ideas for new spin-out companies based on their research. - The government is announcing \u00a34.2 million, subject to business case, for the remediation of brownfield land in Port Talbot supporting the Harbourside Innovation District, aligned to the Celtic Freeport, helping to unlock further investment. - The government is announcing \u00a31.5 million of funding for three Welsh automotive companies from the latest DRIVE35 programme funding round. - The government recognises the growth potential of the Cardiff Parkway development. The government will work with the Welsh Government and the private sector to develop plans for the delivery and funding of a station to serve the area as soon as possible with government support. This builds on progress since the launch of the UK's Modern Industrial Strategy and Spending Review 2025 by providing funding for projects and creating an environment for investment, which includes: - Enhancing economic connectivity for Wales. Spending Review 2025 and the Infrastructure Strategy recognised Wales's long-term infrastructure needs and included at least \u00a3445 million of funding to realise them, including funding to upgrade the Core Valley Lines, enhancements to Cardiff Central Station and to increase connectivity across Wales. - Approval of the full business case for Anglesey Freeport. A Memorandum of Understanding can now be signed with the Welsh Government, releasing \u00a325 million of government seed capital funding. The Freeport tax sites are now live, meaning the Freeport is fully open for business, with a focus on the renewable energy and digital and data technology sectors. The Freeport's interventions will upgrade and decarbonise power provision to the Port of Holyhead, part-fund the Egni building at M-SParc to drive low-carbon innovation and commercialisation, and fund work to develop underutilised sites. Businesses located on the tax sites will also benefit from a range of incentives and tax reliefs. - Final approval by the UK and Welsh Governments of the Flintshire and Wrexham (North Wales) Investment Zone, the first Investment Zone outside England to enter delivery. Backed by \u00a3160 million government funding over 10 years, the zone focuses on advanced manufacturing.

Pembrokeshire will benefit directly from a skills pilot scheme which will support people in local communities to get jobs in clean energy. [footnote 251] - The government provided \u00a32.4 million in funding over the Spending Review period to launch a new Brand Wales Programme, promoting Welsh investment opportunities and exports around the world. [footnote 252] - The recent announcement of a new Defence Growth Deal being developed for Wales, which will add to the 3,900 jobs already directly supported by the government's defence spending in Wales. [footnote 253] The government is also taking action to alleviate the cost of living through making the biggest investment in employment support for disabled people and those with health conditions in at least a generation. [footnote 254] Using funding announced earlier this year, the government's Pathways to Work Guarantee will ensure anyone in Wales claiming out-of-work benefits who is disabled or has a health condition will have access to a specialist work coach, and personalised work, health and skills support. The government will also transfer the Investment Reserve Fund in the British Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme to the scheme's Trustees. This will be paid out as an additional pension to members of the scheme. As well as directly delivering for Wales, the government also funds the Welsh Government to deliver on its devolved priorities. Spending Review 2025 provided the Welsh Government with its largest spending review settlements in real terms since devolution in 1998. As a result of decisions at Budget 2025, the Welsh Government will receive an additional \u00a3320 million resource funding and \u00a3185 million capital funding through the operation of the Barnett formula on top of these record settlements. This means the Welsh Government's settlement continues to grow in real terms between 2024 -25 and 2028 -29. The Welsh Government continues to receive at least 20% more per person than equivalent government spending in the rest of the UK. This ensures the Welsh Government is funded above its independently assessed level of need of 115% in all years of the Spending Review period. To enable the Welsh Government to support people, businesses and public services in Wales, in 2026-27 the Welsh Government's annual and cumulative capital borrowing limits, overall Wales Reserve limit and"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "annual Resource Departmental Expenditure Limit (RDEL) and Capital Departmental Expenditure Limit (CDEL) drawdown limits will all be increased by 10%. From 2027-28, each of those limits will be uprated annually in line with inflation. The government will also provide a temporary waiver of the Wales Reserve drawdown limits in 202627. ## 7.4 Northern Ireland The government is continuing to invest in Northern Ireland's economic potential and unique contributions to the UK. The Budget builds on the government's record settlement for the Northern Ireland Executive provided at Spending Review 2025 through measures to support growth in Northern Ireland. To help businesses navigate the Windsor Framework, the government will provide \u00a316.6 million of new funding over the next three years for an Internal Market Package to boost trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. This will create an enhanced 'one stop shop' support service that will help businesses unlock the full opportunities of trading across the UK internal market and enable businesses based in Northern Ireland to take advantage of their access to the UK and EU markets. The Internal Market Package will be delivered in partnership between the government and Northern Ireland Executive, ensuring support meets local needs and benefits the economy of Northern Ireland. The UK Internal Market Package includes \u00a32.25 million of new funding for Intertrade UK to forge and strengthen trade and business links between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The work of Intertrade UK will focus on supporting businesses to overcome existing barriers to trade, promoting opportunities for connection and growth within the UK internal market, and enhancing connectivity between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The Budget confirms advanced manufacturing as the sector focus for the Enhanced Investment Zone in Northern Ireland, targeting clusters in photonics and biotechnology. The government and the Northern Ireland Executive are exploring a range of interventions - across business support, R&amp;D, skills, local infrastructure, and support for green industries - to strengthen these chosen sectors. The Department for the Economy in Northern Ireland expects it to leverage over \u00a3230 million in private investment and support the creation of more than 1,000 jobs over the next 10 years. [footnote 255] This follows the government's recent investment in Northern Ireland's high -potential sectors, including tech, defence and the creative industries: - At the Spending Review, the government confirmed \u00a3310 million over four years for Northern Ireland's four City and Growth Deals. These deals are a collaboration with the Northern Ireland Executive and are a primary mechanism for funding large-scale R&amp;D projects, including Belfast Region City Deal investment in: - Queen's University Belfast Advanced Manufacturing Innovation Centre (AMIC). This \u00a3100 million R&amp;D centre is set to open in 2026 and will provide state-of-the-art engineering facilities for businesses. - Studio Ulster, a \u00a325.2 million government investment in a state-of-the-art virtual production R&amp;D studio. - \u00a330 million direct award for the Belfast to Derry-Londonderry Corridor as part of the Local Innovation Partnerships Fund. - The recent announcement of a new Defence Growth Deal being developed for Northern"}, {"file": "Budget 2025 (HTML) - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "Ireland, which will add to the 900 jobs already directly supported by the government's defence spending in Northern Ireland. [footnote 256] As well as directly delivering for Northern Ireland, the government also funds the Northern Ireland Executive to deliver on its devolved priorities. The Spending Review provided the Northern Ireland Executive with its largest spending review settlements in real terms since devolution in 1998. As a result of decisions at Budget 2025, the Northern Ireland Executive will receive an additional \u00a3240 million resource funding and \u00a3130 million capital funding through the operation of the Barnett formula on top of these record settlements. This means the Northern Ireland Executive's settlement continues to grow in real terms between 2024 -25 and 2028 -29. The Northern Ireland Executive continues to receive at least 24% more per person than equivalent government spending in the rest of the UK in all years of the spending review period. This ensures the Northern Ireland Executive is funded above its independently assessed level of need (124%). To make sure support goes to those who truly need it, the government will work with the Northern Ireland Executive over the coming months on ways to tackle welfare fraud and error in Northern Ireland and on different funding options, including the potential to share a portion of resulting savings with the Executive. ## 8.

The \u00a3150 is a rounded \u00a3154 average per household figure. This is composed of a forecast \u00a388 saving from funding 75% of the domestic share of the Renewables Obligation (RO) via the Exchequer; \u00a359 is from not renewing the Energy Company Obligation (ECO); and \u00a37 from VAT savings as a result of these measures. The RO bills impact is obtained by dividing the total forecast cost of the RO to households in GB in 2026-27 by the number of households in GB. For ECO, the average bill impact is the projected spending that would have happened on this scheme divided by the number of GB households. The number of households in GB is taken from the ONS Living Costs and Food Survey (https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinance s/expenditure/datasets/familyspendingworkbook3expenditurebyregion) for 2021-24 and this is grown in line with the OBR's over-16 population determinant. Ofgem's energy bill price cap is measured for the current typical domestic consumption values for a dual fuel household - based on median consumption levels using data from 2019 and 2021 (these measures predominantly affect electricity bills). The impact is equivalent to \u00a3134 off the price cap (based on policy costs in the Q1 2026 dual fuel cap announced on 21 November 2025 (https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/energy-regulation/domestic-and-nondomestic/energy-pricing-rules/energy-price-cap/energy-price-cap-default-tariff-levels)).

(2) The excess (if any) of the reported income of the reporting fund in respect of the investment over the amount distributed by the reporting fund in respect of that investment is treated for income tax and corporation tax purposes as additional income of the participants in the RIF in proportion to their rights in the RIF. (3) If the reporting fund does not make a report available in accordance with regulation 90(5) of the Offshore Funds (Tax) Regulations 2009- of Property Categories in Section 520 of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005) Regulations 2017 (S.I. 2017/1182) and section 10 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2017. ( a ) Section 528 was amended by paragraph 4(3) of Schedule 4 to the Finance Act 2012, regulation 2(2) of the Real Estate Investment Trust (Amendments to the Corporation Tax Act 2010 and Consequential Amendments) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/518), paragraph 2 of Schedule 3 to the Finance Act 2022 and paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of Schedule 7 to the Finance Act 2024 (c. 3). Section 535A was added by paragraph 115 of Schedule 1(2) to the Finance Act 2019 and the section was amended by paragraph 9 of Schedule 7 to the Finance Act 2024. ( b ) Relevant amending instruments are S.I. 2011/1211, 2013/1411 and 2017/240. 'Non-reporting fund' is defined in regulation 4(2), 'reportable income' in regulation 63(4), 'reported income' in regulation 92(2) and 'reporting fund' in regulation 50 of those Regulations. ( c ) 'RIF' is defined as a Reserved Investor Fund (Contractual Scheme) in section [x] to the Finance (No. 2) Act 2024. - (a) the operator of the RIF must estimate the amount of excess (if any) of the reportable income of the reporting fund in respect of the investment over the amount distributed by the reporting fund in respect of that investment, and - (b) the estimated amount is treated for income tax and corporation tax purposes as additional income of the participants in the RIF in proportion to their rights in the RIF. (4) Where paragraph (3) applies, in the first accounting period in which the operator has sufficient information to accurately determine the amount of any excess estimated under that paragraph, the operator must make any necessary corrections by adjusting the estimated amount for that accounting period. (5) The additional income is treated as arising on the information reporting date in respect of the accounting period in which the excess is treated as made under the Offshore Funds (Tax) Regulations 2009. ## Investments in non-reporting offshore funds: first case 17. -(1) This regulation applies if- - (a) a RIF has made an investment for its purposes in a non-reporting fund,"}, {"file": "_Draft__The_Co-ownership_Contractual_Schemes__Tax__Regulations.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "and - (b) the conditions in paragraph (2) are met for an accounting period. (2) The conditions are that- - (a) the RIF has access to the accounts of the non-reporting fund, - (b) the RIF has sufficient information about the non-reporting fund to enable it to prepare a computation of reportable income for the fund, and - (c) the RIF can reasonably expect to rely on continued access to that information for the period in which it will hold the investment in the fund. (3) The amount that would be the excess, if any, of the reportable income of the non-reporting fund in respect of the investment over the amount distributed by the non-reporting fund in respect of that investment is treated for income tax and corporation tax purposes as additional income of the participants in the RIF in proportion to their rights in the RIF. (4) The additional income is treated as arising on the information reporting date in respect of the accounting period to which the excess relates. ## Investments in non-reporting offshore funds: second case 18. -(1) This regulation applies if a RIF has made an investment for its purposes in a non-reporting fund, but the conditions in regulation 17(2) are not met for an accounting period. (2) The increase in fair value of the investment in the non-reporting fund in that period is treated for income tax and corporation tax purposes as additional income of the participants in the RIF in proportion to their rights in the RIF. (3) Decreases in the fair value of that interest in earlier accounting periods may be set against the increase referred to in paragraph (2) to reduce the amount of the increase, but- - (a) not to below zero, and - (b) only to the extent that the decreases in fair value have not previously had the effect of reducing the amount of a fair value increase. (4) The additional income is treated as arising on the information reporting date in respect of the accounting period in which the fair value increase arises. (5) In this regulation 'fair value' in relation to an interest in a non-reporting fund means the amount which, at the time the value is to be determined, is the amount for which the interest could be exchanged between knowledgeable and willing parties dealing at arm's length. ## Interpretation: Part 3 19. In this Part- 'depositary', in relation to a co-ownership scheme, has the meaning given by section 237(2) of FISMA 2000; 'disposal', in relation to an asset, has the same meaning as in TCGA 1992; 'F(No.2)A 2024' means the Finance (No.2) Act 2024; 'FISMA 2000' means the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000; 'the operator', in relation to a co-ownership scheme, has the meaning given by section 237(2) of FISMA 2000 (see paragraph (aa) of that definition); 'participant', in relation to a co-ownership scheme, is to be read in accordance with section 235 of that Act; 'qualifying conditions' is to be read in accordance"}, {"file": "_Draft__The_Co-ownership_Contractual_Schemes__Tax__Regulations.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "with regulation 20(3); 'restriction conditions' is to be read in accordance with regulation 24(2); 'restriction requirement' is to be read in accordance with regulation 24(1). ## Chapter 2 ## Qualifying conditions ## Qualifying conditions 20. -(1) Paragraph (2) sets out conditions (in addition to those in section [x] of F(No.2)A 2024) that a co-ownership scheme must meet in order to be a RIF. (2) Those conditions are that- - (a) the scheme is UK-based (see regulation 21); - (b) the scheme meets the genuine diversity of ownership condition (see regulation 22) or the non-close condition (see regulation 23), and - (c) the scheme meets the restriction requirement (see regulation 24). (3) In these regulations, the conditions in section [x] of F(No.2)A 2024 and those in paragraph (2) are, together, referred to as the 'qualifying conditions'. ## A UK-based scheme 21. -(1) This regulation applies for the purposes of regulation 20(2)(a). (2) A co-ownership scheme is UK-based if- - (a) the operator and depositary of the scheme are bodies corporate incorporated in the United Kingdom which administer their respective affairs in the United Kingdom, ## PART 3 ## Reserved Investor Fund (Contractual Schemes): general ## Chapter 1 ## Interpretation - (b) the operator and depositary of the scheme both have a place of business in the United Kingdom, and - (c) the deed setting out the arrangements which constitute the scheme (see section 235A(3) of FISMA 2000) is made under and governed by the law of England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland and contains a statement to that effect. ## Genuine diversity of ownership condition 22. -(1) This regulation applies for the purposes of regulation 20(2)(b). (2) A co-ownership scheme which is not part of multi-vehicle arrangements meets the genuine diversity of ownership condition at any time that the scheme meets- - (a) each of the conditions in regulation 75(2), (3) and (4)(a) of the Offshore Funds Tax Regulations 2009 ('the 2009 Regulations'), or - (b) the condition in regulation 75(5) of those Regulations (assuming for this purpose that regulation 75(4)(b) is omitted). (3) A co-ownership scheme which is part of multi-vehicle arrangements meets the genuine diversity of ownership condition at any time that the scheme meets, or the arrangements meet, each of the conditions mentioned in paragraph (2)(a) or the condition mentioned in paragraph (2)(b). (4) The fact that (for any reason) the capacity of a co-ownership scheme, or multi-vehicle arrangements, to receive investments is limited does not prevent regulation 75(3) of the 2009 Regulations (including as it applies for the purposes of regulation 75(5) of those Regulations) from being met for the purposes of this paragraph. (5) But paragraph (4) does not apply if- - (a) the limited capacity of the scheme, or the arrangements, to receive investments is fixed by the documents of the scheme or the arrangements (or otherwise), and - (b) a pre-determined number of specific persons, or specific groups of connected persons, make investments in the scheme, or the arrangements, that collectively exhausts all,"}, {"file": "_Draft__The_Co-ownership_Contractual_Schemes__Tax__Regulations.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "or substantially all, of that capacity. (6) In this paragraph 'multi-vehicle arrangements' means arrangements comprising two or more collective investment schemes (as defined in section 235 of FISMA 2000) under which an investor in one of those schemes would reasonably regard that investment as an investment in the arrangements as a whole rather than exclusively in any particular scheme. (7) The 2009 Regulations have effect for the purposes of this paragraph as if references in the regulations to a fund were references to a co-ownership scheme and included- - (a) references to multi-vehicle arrangements, and - (b) references to a co-ownership scheme which is not an offshore fund. (8) For the purposes of paragraph (5), terms used in that paragraph and in regulation 76 of the 2009 Regulations have the meanings they have in that regulation. ## Non-close condition 23. -(1) This regulation applies for the purposes of regulation 20(2)(b). (2) A co-ownership scheme meets the non-close condition at any time that were it a company- - (a) it would not be a close company in accordance with the rules in Chapter 2 of Part 10 of CTA 2010, or - (b) it would be a close company but only because it has a qualifying investor as a direct or indirect participator. (3) Paragraph (4) applies where a co-ownership scheme- - (a) ceases to meet the non-close condition for a period of no more than 30 days, and - (b) meets the condition again at the end of that period. (4) Where this paragraph applies, the failure to meet the condition is treated for the purposes of this Schedule as if it had not occurred. (5) For the purposes of considering whether a co-ownership scheme meets the non-close condition under paragraph (2), the rules in Chapter 2 of Part 10 of CTA 2010 are to be applied as if- - (a) the scheme were a company, - (b) the rights of the participants in the scheme were shares in the company, and - (c) the modifications to the rules set out in paragraphs (a) to (e) of paragraph 46(2) of Schedule 5AAA to TCGA 1992 applied. (6) In paragraph (2)(b), the following terms have the meaning given in paragraph 46 of Schedule 5AAA to TCGA 1992- - (a) 'direct participator'; - (b) 'indirect participator'; - (c) 'qualifying investor'. ## Restriction requirement 24. -(1) A co-ownership scheme meets the restriction requirement for the purposes of regulation 20(2)(c) at any time when it meets one or more of the restriction conditions. (2) The 'restriction conditions' are- - (a) the non-UK property assets condition (see regulation 25); - (b) the UK property rich condition (see regulation 26); - (c) the exempt investor condition (see regulation 27). ## Non-UK property assets condition 25. -(1) This regulation applies for the purposes of regulation 24(2)(a). (2) A scheme meets the non-UK property assets condition if- - (a) it has no assets which are interests in UK land, and - (b) it has no assets that derive"}, {"file": "_Draft__The_Co-ownership_Contractual_Schemes__Tax__Regulations.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "75% or more of their value from UK land, ignoring an interest falling within paragraph (3). (3) An interest falls within this paragraph if- - (a) it is held by a scheme which meets the non-UK real estate condition (see paragraph (4)), - (b) it is an interest or right in a collective investment vehicle which- - (i) is a company, or is assumed to be a company under paragraph 4 of Schedule 5AAA to TCGA 1992 for the purposes of that Schedule, and - (ii) is UK property rich for the purposes of that Schedule (see in particular paragraph 3 of that Schedule), and - (c) the interest or right does not constitute a 10% investment in that vehicle. (4) A scheme meets the non-UK real estate condition at any time if, by reference to the prospectus for the scheme as it has effect at that time, less than 10% of the expected market value of the scheme's investments is intended to be derived from investments consisting of rights or interests in companies which are UK property rich. (5) In determining for the purposes of paragraph (3)(c) whether an interest or right constitutes a 10% investment in a vehicle, the rule in paragraph 9 of Schedule 1A to TCGA 1992 is to be applied, but for this purpose- - (a) paragraph 10 of that Schedule is to be ignored, and - (b) references to 25% are to be taken as references to 10%. (6) In sub-paragraph (2)(a) 'an interest in UK land' has the meaning it has in section 1C of TCGA 1992. (7) In paragraph (4) 'prospectus', in relation to a scheme, means any document (however described) which is made available to participants (or potential participants) and which sets out descriptions of the investments to be made, or intended to be made, by the scheme. (8) Part 2 of Schedule 1A to TCGA 1992 applies for the purpose of determining whether a scheme has an asset that derives 75% or more of its value from UK land for the purposes of sub-paragraph (2)(b), but for those purposes- - (a) references to the time of the disposal are to be read as if they were references to the time at which the determination is being made, and - (b) references to a person are to be read as if they were references to a scheme. (9) In this paragraph references to 'UK property rich' are to be read in accordance with Schedule 1A to TCGA 1992. ## UK property rich condition 26. -(1) This regulation applies for the purpose of regulation 24(2)(b). (2) A scheme meets the UK property rich condition if- - (a) it is UK property rich for the purposes of Schedule 5AAA to TCGA 1992, and - (b) if the scheme relies on meeting the non-close condition for the purposes of qualifying as a RIF, it also meets the UK tax condition. (3) A scheme meets the UK tax condition if (were it a company) it"}, {"file": "_Draft__The_Co-ownership_Contractual_Schemes__Tax__Regulations.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "would meet the UK tax condition for the purposes of paragraph 13 of Schedule 5AAA to TCGA 1992 (see sub-paragraph (7) of that paragraph), applying those rules as if- - (a) the scheme were a company, and - (b) the rights of participants in the scheme were shares in the company. ## Exempt investor condition 27. -(1) This regulation applies for the purposes of regulation 24(2)(c). (2) A scheme meets the exempt investor condition at any time that all of its participants are exempt from tax on gains. (3) A participant is exempt from tax on gains if- - (a) any gain accruing in the event of a disposal of the participant's units would be wholly exempt from capital gains tax or corporation tax (otherwise than by reason of residence), or - (b) the participant holds all of their units pending disposal in the capacity as operator of the scheme. ## Change in restrictions conditions met 28. -(1) A RIF's status as a RIF is unaffected by any change in which of the restriction conditions the RIF meets at any time (so long as the RIF continues to meet at least one of those conditions). (2) But paragraph (3) applies where- - (a) a RIF's status as such has at any time depended on it meeting the UK property rich condition, - (b) the RIF ceases to meet that condition at a particular time, and - (c) on ceasing to meet that condition at that time, the RIF meets the non-UK property assets condition. (3) Each participant in the RIF is deemed for the purposes of TCGA 1992 to, immediately before the time that the RIF ceases to meet the UK property rich condition, have- - (a) sold their units in the RIF, and - (b) reacquired those units, at their market value at that time. (4) The operator of a RIF must notify the participants in the RIF and HMRC if there is a change in which of the restriction conditions the RIF meets. (5) Notices under paragraph (4) must be given in writing and by the end of the period of 30 days beginning with the day on which the change occurs. ## Rectification of breach of restriction requirement 29. -(1) This regulation applies where- - (a) a RIF breaches the restriction requirement, - (b) the operator of the RIF has given HMRC a notification in relation to the breach in accordance with regulation 38, - (c) the notification confirms that the RIF intends to rely on a cure period, and - (d) before the end of the cure period, the breach has been rectified. (2) The breach is treated for the purposes of these Regulations as if it had not occurred. (3) But each participant in the RIF is deemed for the purposes of TCGA 1992 to, immediately before the time of the breach have- - (a) sold their units in the RIF, and - (b) reacquired those units, at their market value at that time (and"}, {"file": "_Draft__The_Co-ownership_Contractual_Schemes__Tax__Regulations.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "see regulation 43 for provision about the deferral of any deemed gains). (4) Subject to paragraph (5), the 'cure period'- - (a) in relation to a breach of the restriction condition by virtue of the RIF ceasing to meet the UK property rich condition, is the period of 9 months beginning with the day on which the breach occurred; - (b) in relation to any other breach of the restriction condition, is the period of 30 days beginning with the day on which the breach occurred. (5) Where, at any time during the cure period mentioned in paragraph (4)(a) (cure period for breach of UK property rich condition), it becomes apparent to the operator of a RIF that there is no reasonable expectation of the UK property rich condition being met by the end of that period- - (a) the operator must notify HMRC of that fact, and - (b) the cure period comes to an end at the end of the day when it became so apparent. (6) If, at the end of a cure period in a case to which paragraph (5) does not apply, the breach has not been rectified, the operator of the RIF must notify HMRC of that fact. (7) A notice under this regulation must be given in writing and by the end of the period of 30 days beginning with the day mentioned in paragraph (5)(b) or (6). ## Chapter 3 ## Becoming a Reserved Investor Fund (Contractual Scheme) ## Timing 30. A co-ownership scheme is a RIF from the beginning of the first day that- - (a) the scheme meets the qualifying conditions as declared in an entry notice in relation to the scheme, and - (b) the entry notice is in force. ## Entry notices: general 31. -(1) An 'entry notice' means a notice given to HMRC by the operator of a co-ownership scheme, setting out- - (a) the name of the scheme, - (b) the date from which the scheme is, or intends to be, a RIF (which may be a past or future date), - (c) a declaration- - (i) in the case of a notice in which the date specified for the purposes of sub-paragraph (b) is a past date, that on that date the scheme met the qualifying conditions and continues to meet those conditions (subject to any declaration under regulation 32); - (ii) in the case of a notice in which the date specified for the purposes of sub-paragraph (b) is a future date, that on that date the scheme will meet the qualifying conditions (subject to any declaration under regulation 32), and - (d) which restriction condition is met by the scheme. (2) An entry notice may be made at any time- - (a) prior to the date specified in the notice for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), or - (b) before the end of the period of 3 months beginning with that date.

(4) Once in force, an entry notice continues in force until- - (a) an exit notice comes into force in relation to the scheme (see regulation 37), - (b) the entry notice is revoked under regulation 39 (revocation to safeguard public revenue), or - (c) the scheme ceases to be a RIF as a result of ceasing to meet the qualifying conditions. (5) An entry notice may not come into force before the date on which this regulation comes into force. ## Entry notices: qualifying conditions treated as met for initial period 32. -(1) A co-ownership scheme may, unless it has previously been a RIF, rely on the application of regulation 33 to enable the scheme to meet the qualifying condition in regulation 20(2)(b) (scheme meets genuine diversity of ownership condition or non-close condition) for the purposes of the scheme becoming a RIF. (2) A co-ownership scheme may, unless it is a scheme that falls within paragraph (3), rely on the application of regulation 34 to enable the scheme to meet the UK property rich condition for the purposes of the scheme becoming a RIF. (3) A co-ownership scheme falls within this paragraph if the scheme- - (a) has previously been a RIF, - (b) has previously been an authorised contractual scheme, - (c) has participants that have been issued with units in the scheme in return for consideration other than money, or - (d) forms part of arrangements the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of which is to obtain a tax advantage.

(2) Where this regulation applies, the scheme is treated as meeting the qualifying condition in regulation 20(2)(b) for the period of 1 year beginning with the date specified for the purposes of regulation 31(1)(b) (date from which the scheme is a RIF). (3) But if, at any time during the period mentioned in paragraph (2), it becomes apparent to the operator that there is no reasonable expectation of that qualifying condition being met by the scheme by the end of that period- - (a) the operator must notify HMRC of that fact as soon as reasonably practicable, and - (b) this regulation ceases to apply in relation to the scheme from the beginning of the day when it became so apparent. (4) A notice under paragraph (3)(a) must be given in writing and by the end of the period of 30 days beginning with the day mentioned in paragraph (3)(b). ## UK property rich condition treated as met for initial period 34. -(1) This regulation applies in relation to a co-ownership scheme where the entry notice in relation to the scheme meets the requirements of regulation 32(5). (2) Where this regulation applies, the scheme is treated as meeting the UK property rich condition for the period of 1 year beginning with the date specified for the purposes of regulation 31(1)(b) (date from which the scheme is a RIF).

(4) This regulation is treated as having never applied in relation to the scheme if a prohibited repayment of capital is made to a participant in the scheme at a time- - (a) which is within the period mentioned in paragraph (2), and - (b) when, ignoring this regulation, the scheme would not meet the UK property rich condition. (5) In paragraph (4), a 'prohibited repayment of capital'- - (a) means a payment from the assets of the scheme of an amount which represents, in substance, value derived (directly or indirectly) from a direct disposal of UK land or from the UK land component of an indirect disposal of UK land, and - (b) includes the accrual of an entitlement to such a payment.

(2) In such a case- - (a) the land transaction is the acquisition of the chargeable interests by the RIF (and, accordingly, the RIF is to be treated as the purchaser of the chargeable interests), - (b) the effective date of the transaction is the date specified in the entry notice in relation to the RIF under regulation 31(1)(b), and - (c) the chargeable consideration in respect of the transaction is the market value on that date of the chargeable interests, subject to the rest of this paragraph. (3) Paragraphs (4) and (5) apply in relation to a RIF that has previously been, and then ceased to be, a RIF before becoming a RIF as described in paragraph (1). (4) There is no chargeable consideration in respect of the land transaction if between the time that the RIF previously ceased to be a RIF and the effective date of the transaction- - (a) the scheme has not acquired any chargeable interests, and - (b) there has been no change to the participants in the scheme during that time. (5) If between the time that the RIF previously ceased to be a RIF and the effective date of the land transaction- - (a) there has been no change to the participants in the scheme, but - (b) the scheme has acquired chargeable interests, the chargeable consideration is the market value on the effective date of those chargeable interests acquired.

(2) It is to be assumed (for all purposes"}, {"file": "_Draft__The_Co-ownership_Contractual_Schemes__Tax__Regulations.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "other than regulation 41) that the RIF continues to meet the UK property rich condition.

(3) If, at the time of the deemed disposal or a subsequent time, the person actually disposes of a unit in the relevant scheme, the appropriate portion of the deemed gain is treated as accruing to the person at the time of the actual disposal. (4) For this purpose 'the appropriate portion' means the proportion which the consideration for the actual disposal bears to the amount of the deemed gain. (5) If some of the deemed gain has accrued on one or more previous occasions, the appropriate portion is restricted so that, when added to the appropriate portion or portions on the previous occasion or occasions, it does not exceed 100%. (6) In determining the appropriate proportion, so much (if any) of the consideration for the actual disposal as exceeds the amount of the deemed gain is to be ignored. (7) The remainder of the deemed gain is treated as accruing to the person (unless the whole amount has already accrued)- - (a) in a case set out in paragraph (8), at the earliest of- - (i) the RIF being wound up, or - (ii) an exit notice in relation to the RIF coming into force; - (b) in any other case, the earliest of- - (i) the end of the period of three years beginning with the time of the deemed disposal, - (ii) the RIF being wound up, or - (iii) an exit notice in relation to the RIF coming into force.

(2) Accordingly, references to a co-ownership scheme in regulations 25 to 27 are to be read as if they were references to a sub-scheme of the umbrella co-ownership scheme. (3) Regulation 28 (change in restriction conditions met) applies as if- - (a) it provided that an umbrella RIF's status as a RIF is unaffected by virtue of a change in which of the restriction conditions any of its sub-schemes meets at any time (so long as each sub-scheme continues to meet at least one of those conditions), - (b) paragraph (3) applied where- - (i) a RIF's status as such has at any time depended on one of its sub-schemes meeting the UK property rich condition, - (ii) the sub-scheme ceases to meet that condition at a particular time, and - (iii) on ceasing to meet that condition, it meets the non-UK property assets condition, and - (c) references to a RIF in paragraphs (3) and (4) were references to the sub-scheme. (4) Regulation 29 (rectification of breach of restriction condition) applies as if- - (a) the reference in paragraph (1)(a) to a RIF breaching the restriction requirement were a reference to an umbrella RIF breaching the restriction requirement as a result of a sub-scheme of the RIF ceasing to meet at least one of the restriction conditions, and - (b) references to a RIF in paragraphs (3) to (6) were references to the sub-scheme. ## Umbrella schemes: becoming a Reserved Investor Fund (Contractual Scheme) 55. -(1) Regulation 31 (entry notices) applies in relation to an umbrella co-ownership scheme as if the requirement in paragraph (1)(d) were a requirement to set out which restriction condition is met by each of the sub-schemes of the umbrella co-ownership scheme. (2) Regulation 32(2) applies as if it provided for an umbrella co-ownership scheme to rely on the application of regulation 34 (as modified below) to enable a sub-scheme of the scheme to meet the UK property rich condition for the purposes of the scheme becoming a RIF (but this is subject to paragraph (4)). (3) In such a case- - (a) the requirements of regulation 32(5) apply as if references to the scheme in paragraphs (a) to (c) were references to the sub-scheme, and - (b) regulation 34 applies as if references to a co-ownership scheme were references to a sub-scheme of an umbrella co-ownership scheme (except for those references that relate to an entry notice in relation to the scheme). (4) An umbrella co-ownership scheme may not rely on regulation 34 in relation to a sub-scheme of the scheme if- - (a) the scheme has previously been a RIF, - (b) the scheme"}, {"file": "_Draft__The_Co-ownership_Contractual_Schemes__Tax__Regulations.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "has previously been an authorised contractual scheme, - (c) the sub-scheme has participants that have been issued with units in the sub-scheme in return for consideration other than money, or - (d) the scheme, or any of its sub-schemes, form part of arrangements the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of which is to obtain a tax advantage. ## Umbrella schemes: ceasing to be a Reserved Investor Fund (Contractual Scheme) 56. -(1) Regulation 42 does not apply in relation to an umbrella RIF. (2) Paragraph (3) applies where a sub-scheme ceases to meet the UK property rich condition at a time when the operator of the sub-scheme is taking steps with a view to disposal of all the assets of the sub-scheme so that it can be wound up. (3) Where this paragraph applies- - (a) regulation 41 does not apply, - (b) each participant in the sub-scheme is deemed for the purposes of TCGA 1992 to, immediately before the time that it ceases to meet the UK property rich condition, have- - (i) sold their units in the sub-scheme, and - (ii) reacquired those units, at their market value at that time, and - (c) for all other purposes, it is to be assumed that the sub-scheme continues to meet the UK property rich condition. (4) But if the winding up of the sub-scheme fails to be completed within a reasonable period of time, paragraph (3) is treated as never having applied. Name Name Two of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury ## EXPLANATORY NOTE ## (This note is not part of the Regulations) These Regulations set out tax rules for a new type of investment fund, the Reserved Investor Fund (Contractual Scheme) ('RIF'), and its investors. In addition, they make minor changes to the tax rules for Co-ownership Authorised Contractual Schemes ('CoACS'), a similar type of investment fund. Part 2 introduces new tax rules for RIFs mainly by amending existing primary legislation related to CoACS to extend the application of those provisions to RIFs, or where relevant, modifying the application of provisions applying to CoACS and RIFs. The changes address issues that are relevant for RIFs, but also affect CoACS and ensure consistency of application between the two regimes. Part 3 sets out supplementary qualifying conditions for a RIF (in addition to the conditions contained within [section 20 of the Finance (No.2) Act 2024 (c. *)], entry and exit provisions, accounting provisions, information requirements, penalties for failure to give information or requisite notice and umbrella scheme provisions.

This publication is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/benefits-in-kindeasement-for-plug-in-hybrid-electric-vehicles/plug-in-hybrid-electric-vehicles-benefits-in-kindeasement ## Who is likely to be affected Businesses and employers who provide plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) company cars and employees provided with PHEV company cars that are made available for private use. ## General description of the measure As announced in Budget 2025, the government is introducing a temporary easement to mitigate the increasing benefit in kind tax liabilities of PHEV company cars due to new emission standards. The easement will apply retrospectively from 1 January 2025 to 5 April 2028. Transitional arrangements will apply to certain PHEVs until 5 April 2031. When an employer makes a company car available for private use there is a benefit in kind Income Tax charge to the employee, and an employer National Insurance contributions charge. The charge is calculated using CO2 emissions and, where relevant, the electric mileage range of the vehicle. New European Union (EU) and United Nations (UN) emission standards introduced from 1 January 2025 observe higher CO2 emissions for PHEVs than previous standards. The EU Euro 6e standard applies in Northern Ireland, and the equivalent UN standard currently applies UK-wide. This change increases the car benefit charge due on PHEV company cars. During the easement period, the CO2 emission figure for certain PHEVs will be deemed to be a nominal figure for the purposes of the benefit in kind charge rather than the CO2 figure on the registration document. This will have the effect of reducing the value of the benefit-in-kind charge that applies. ## Policy objective This measure aims to ensure consistency in the tax treatment of company cars across the United Kingdom by mitigating the impact of updated emission standards on PHEVs. ## Background to the measure The government published its intention to mitigate the impacts of the new emission standards on 21 July 2025 through a written ministerial statement (https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2025-0721/hlws874). The written ministerial statement also committed to extend the easement retroactively in Northern Ireland to 1 January 2025, where the new emission standard already applies. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date This measure will have effect retrospectively from 1 January 2025 to 5 April 2028. Anyone accessing an eligible PHEV company car on or before 5 April 2028"}, {"file": "Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles \u2014 benefits in kind easement - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "will remain eligible for the easement until the earlier of variation or renewal of the arrangement or 5 April 2031. ## Current law The current law is included in Chapter 6 of Part 3 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (ITEPA). Sections 121 to 148 provide for calculating the cash equivalent of the benefit of a vehicle which is made available for private use. In broad terms, this depends on the list price of the car plus taxable accessories, multiplied by the level of CO2 emissions the car produces, which is expressed as the appropriate percentage. Sections 136 to 138 provide for determining the CO2 emission figure for the car. ## Proposed revisions Legislation will be introduced in Finance Bill 2025-26 to make the following changes. Section 138A will be inserted into Chapter 6 and provides for the vehicles CO2 emission figure to be deemed a nominal value of 1 where it meets conditions set out in 138A(1). The conditions that a vehicle must satisfy to be eligible for the easement are, the: - vehicle was first registered on or after 1 January 2025 - vehicle's CO2 emissions figure is 51 or more - vehicle was registered under any emission standard other than Euro 6d-ISCFCM or Euro 6e - car's electric range figure is 1 or more ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact of benefit in kind tax easement (\u00a3 million) | 2025 to 2026 | 2026 to 2027 | 2027 to 2028 | 2028 to 2029 | 2029 to 2030 | 2030 to 2031 | |----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------| | - | +35 | +60 | +75 | +80 | +85 | The costing for this measure has been incorporated, alongside other measures, into the overall 'Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) emissions regulatory standard changes and benefit in kind easement' costing. More details can be found in Table 4.1 of Budget 2025. ## Macroeconomic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. ## Impact on individuals, households and families This measure will impact an estimated 150,000 employees who have private use of a PHEV through their employer. The measure will prevent increased costs for these individuals. Employees affected by the retrospective element of the easement will be able to claim a repayment made on the system used to report the benefit through their employer. This measure is not expected to impact family formation, stability or breakdown. It is expected that some employees provided with a company car by their employer will switch to PHEVs from petrol or diesel cars during the easement period. This measure is expected overall to have no impact on individual's experience of dealing with HMRC as the change will not result in them having direct contact with HMRC as their employers will report the benefit. ## Equalities impacts An individual may be affected by this measure regardless of their protected characteristics. This measure is expected to impact on individuals who are provided a PHEV company car by their employer. HMRC"}, {"file": "Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles \u2014 benefits in kind easement - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "does not currently hold data on the protected characteristics of individuals who are provided a PHEV vehicle and so cannot make an assessment of the impacts on those with shared protected characteristics, however individuals who are provided a company car was used as a proxy for this population. Those aged 35-64 (79%) are estimated to be overrepresented in the population who receive a company car compared to their prevalence in the UK adult population (50%). Males are also estimated to be overrepresented (79%) compared to the UK adult population (50%), as are those from a White English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British ethnic background (88%, compared to 82% in the UK adult population). Where data was available no other protected group was estimated to be overrepresented in the population who receive a company car from their employer. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations This measure is expected to have a negligible impact on businesses which provide affected PHEVs as taxable benefits in kind for their employees. An estimated 100,000 businesses provide company cars of various kinds to their employees, a proportion of those will be affected PHEVs. Affected employers will need to report the nominal CO2 set out in legislation rather than the CO2 figure listed on the vehicle's registration document. One-off costs could include employers and employees needing to familiarise themselves with the changes through guidance and record the changes through payroll. It is not anticipated there will be any ongoing costs since most employers will already operate a payroll and provide benefits. Customer experience is expected overall to have no impact on businesses' experience of dealing with HMRC as this does not change any processes or tax admin obligations This measure is not expected to impact civil society organisations. ## Operational impact (\u00a3 million) (HMRC or other) Our current understanding is the operational impacts on HMRC are expected to be relatively small and will be dealt with as part of business as usual. ## Other impacts This measure has a behavioural impact by incentivising businesses to purchase PHEV company cars to support the government's wider objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Other impacts have been considered, and none have been identified. ## Monitoring and evaluation The policy will be kept under review through regular communication with taxpayer groups affected by the measure. ## Further advice If you have any questions about this change, email the employment benefit and expenses policy team at policyemploymentbenefitsexpenses@hmrc.gov.uk.

That section subjected to tax the trading income of overseas Dominion Governments. ## Policy objective The measure removes an obsolete provision, thereby modernising the legislation and giving certainty to taxpayers. ## Background to the measure On 4 July 2022 the government published a consultation on whether to reform sovereign immunity from direct taxation. The consultation included a proposal to repeal s.25, which attracted no comments. The meaning of 'Dominion governments' is uncertain and it is arguable that it no longer applies to any states. This legislation addresses any residual uncertainty. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date The measure will have effect from the date of Royal Assent to Finance Bill 202526. ## Current law The current law is contained in s.25 Finance Act 1925. ## Proposed revisions The measure repeals s.25 Finance Act 1925. ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3 million) | 2025 to 2026 | 2026 to 2027 | 2027 to 2028 | 2028 to 2029 | 2029 to 2030 | 2030 to 2031 | |----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------| | nil | nil | nil | nil | nil | nil | This measure is not expected to have an Exchequer impact. ## Macroeconomic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. ## Impact on individuals, households and families The measure has no impact on individuals or households.

The government will also take a regulation-making power to allow HMRC to legislate for CMP schemes more efficiently in the future. ## Policy objective This measure will allow for the smooth operation of the Department for Work and Pensions' upcoming legislation on the expansion of CMP schemes, allowing commencement without delay. The measure will also enable HMRC to more efficiently legislate for any relevant and required changes to enable CMP benefits to be provided, including under the 'guided retirement' provisions being legislated for under the Pension Schemes Bill 2025. ## Background to the measure The Pension Schemes Act 2021 introduced CMP schemes (also known as collective defined contribution (CDC) schemes) as a new type of trust based occupational pension scheme. Currently CMP schemes are only available to single or connected employers. However, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) are expanding this to allow for unconnected, multiple employer schemes (UMES). As UMES are not intended to be used for employees of the person establishing the scheme, they are not occupational pension schemes (OPS) for tax purposes. Where a scheme is not an OPS, unless the person setting up the scheme has permission under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FISMA) to establish a personal pension scheme or stakeholder pension scheme, an application to register the scheme cannot be made. CMP schemes, like Master Trust schemes, are required to be authorised by the Pensions Regulator (TPR) to be able to operate lawfully. HMRC has the ability to decide not to register or to de-register a Master Trust scheme that is not authorised by TPR. Current legislation could require HMRC to register a CMP scheme that failed TPR authorisation requirements. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date The measure will have effect from the date of Royal Assent to Finance Bill"}, {"file": "Collective money purchase scheme \u2014 registration for unconnected multiple employers - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "202526. However, the provisions relating to UMES will be operational only after the Department for Work and Pensions UMES legislation has taken effect. ## Current law The current law is: - Part 4 of Finance Act 2004 (as amended by subsequent Finance Acts and supporting regulations) - Pension Schemes Act 2017 (as amended by subsequent Acts and supporting regulations) - Pension Schemes Act 2021 (as amended by subsequent Acts and supporting regulations) ## Proposed revisions The government will introduce legislation in Finance Bill 2025-26 so that certain CMP schemes are: - treated as occupational pension schemes (OPS) for tax purposes - capable of applying to HMRC to be registered for tax purposes under Part 4 of Finance Act 2004 - capable of being refused registration by HMRC if the CMP scheme is not authorised by TPR - capable of being de-registered if the CMP scheme becomes unauthorised The government will also introduce a regulation making power so that HMRC can more efficiently legislate for necessary changes to CMP schemes or benefits in the future. ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact \u00a3 million) | 2025 to 2026 | 2026 to 2027 | 2027 to 2028 | 2028 to 2029 | 2029 to 2030 | 2030 to 2031 | |----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------| | Nil | Nil | Nil | Nil | Nil | Nil | This measure is not expected to have an Exchequer impact. ## Macroeconomic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. ## Impact on individuals, households and families The proposed change will affect pension scheme administrators only and is not expected to have any impact on individuals, households and families. The measure is not expected to impact on family formation, stability or breakdown. ## Equalities impacts The proposed change will only affect pension scheme administrators, therefore, it is not anticipated that there will be any disproportionate impacts on those in groups sharing protected characteristics. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations This measure is expected to have no impact on business and civil society organisations' administrative burdens, with no one-off costs or continuous costs. The measure will not disproportionately impact certain business sectors since it is a technical change to the legislation. This measure is expected overall to have no impact on businesses' experience of dealing with HMRC as the change does not impact the way they would interact with HMRC. ## Operational impact (\u00a3 million) (HMRC or other) There will be no operational impact on HMRC as a result of this measure. ## Other impacts Other impacts have been considered, and none have been identified. ## Monitoring and evaluation This measure is a change to an existing policy owned by DWP. It will be monitored as part of the existing monitoring an evaluation plan of that existing policy. ## Further advice If you have any questions about this change, contact HMRC Pensions Tax Policy team at policypensions@hmrc.gov.uk.

This publication is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/creative-industries-andresearch-and-development-tax-reliefs-administrative-changes/creative-industries-and-research-anddevelopment-expenditure-credits-administrative-measures ## Who is likely to be affected Companies claiming Research &amp; Development Expenditure Credits (RDEC), and companies claiming Audio-Visual Expenditure Credits (AVEC) or Video Games Expenditure Credits (VGEC) for film, TV programme or video game production. ## General description of the measure The measure contains three technical amendments: 1. Additional wording to clarify that payments made between group companies in return for one company surrendering RDEC, AVEC or VGEC to the other company are to be ignored for Corporation Tax purposes. Payments are only ignored if they do not exceed the amount of the credit surrendered. 2. VGEC only - a correction of the transitional rules for video games which switch from the Video Games Tax Relief regime to VGEC, so that European expenditure is accounted for at step 2 of the VGEC calculation. 3. AVEC only - updates to the calculation of special credit for visual effects (VFX) to prevent anomalous results and set out the treatment of negative results if they arise. ## Policy objective Amendment 1 provides clarity for claimants, and addresses a long-standing ask from companies for an agreed treatment concerning payments in return for credit. Amendment 2 will ensure the transitional rules between Video Games Tax Relief and VGEC reflect the intended policy of including qualifying expenditure from previous periods when calculating VGEC claims. Amendment 3 ensures fairness between companies claiming special VFX credit, by closing a loophole in the current rules that would otherwise result in unintended generosity for some companies, and by preventing incorrect calculation results from occurring for some companies. ## Background to the measure RDEC was introduced from 1 April 2013 for companies carrying out research &amp; development activities. AVEC and VGEC were introduced from 1 January 2024 and will fully replace the existing Film, High-end Television, Animation, Children's Television and Video Games Tax Reliefs from 1 April 2027. This measure was announced at Budget 2025 and will be legislated in Finance Bill 2025-26. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date Amendment 1 will have effect for payments made on or after 26 November 2025. Amendment 2 will have effect for video games which switch to VGEC in an accounting period beginning on"}, {"file": "Creative industries and Research and Development Expenditure Credits \u2014 administrative measures - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "or after 26 November 2025. Amendment 3 will have effect for claims to AVEC and special credit for VFX in respect of accounting periods beginning on or after 26 November 2025. ## Current law For amendment 1, the current law is included in sections 1042N and 1179CE Corporation Tax Act (CTA) 2009. For amendment 2, the current law is in Part 5 of Schedule 2 to the Finance Act 2024. For amendment 3, the current law is in section 1179EC CTA 2009. ## Proposed revisions Amendment 1 will insert wording into the current law sections, stipulating that where: - a company surrenders an amount of RDEC, AVEC or VGEC to a company in the same group - the recipient company makes a payment to the surrendering company in return - the payment does not exceed the amount of credit surrendered The payment in return is to be ignored when calculating the profits of the surrendering company or the recipient company for Corporation Tax purposes. It may still be recognised in the accounts of each company. The payment is also not to be regarded as a distribution for Corporation Tax purposes. Amendment 2 will add to the current transitional rules for video games that move into VGEC from Video Games Tax Relief. The new rule will make it so that step 2 of the VGEC calculation (contained in section 1179CA CTA 2009) reads as though 'UK expenditure' refers to European expenditure in respect of accounting periods before the game switches to VGEC, and UK expenditure for all other accounting periods. This removes the potential for unintended unfair treatment between different video games depending on their European and UK expenditure pattern, and protects VGEC from abuse by closing a loophole which allows some companies to claim more relief than intended. Amendment 3 will amend the special VFX credit legislation. Sometimes, if a company claims special credit over multiple accounting periods, the special credit calculation can produce a negative result. If companies do not claim this negative amount, they will receive more special credit than originally intended by the policy. To counteract this, amendment 3 adds wording to the current law to stipulate that if the special credit calculation gives a negative result, that result must be set against the overall AVEC claimed for the period. To ensure that negative amounts are correctly applied where necessary, companies will be required to make a claim for special credit for every accounting period in respect of which they make a claim to 'regular' AVEC (excluding pre-completion periods). There are also some consequential rules which explain how to treat negative results when making claims in subsequent periods. Note - these changes do not reduce the overall generosity of the AVEC scheme. There is more detail on negative amounts in the Creative Industries Expenditure Credit manual (CREC061400 onwards). Additionally, the special credit calculation assumes that VFX costs are included in the main AVEC calculation before they are included in a claim for special credit.

There is no impact on individuals, households or families. ## Equalities impacts These amendments only affect businesses. Therefore, it is not anticipated that there will be disproportionate impacts on those in groups sharing protected characteristics. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations Overall, Amendment 1 is expected to impact businesses' experience of dealing with HMRC by simplifying processes around payments in return for credit. Amendment 1 will have a negligible administrative impact on the burdens for the roughly 1,900 film, television and video games production companies which can claim AVEC and VGEC, and the roughly 10,000 companies which claim RDEC. Companies in the same company group as RDEC, AVEC and VGEC claimants will also be affected. Ongoing savings will include a reduction in administrative burden for companies by removing any requirement to account for payments in return for credit in tax computations. One-off costs will include familiarisation with the changes. No continuing costs are expected. Amendment 2 will have a negligible administrative impact on the roughly 500 video games development companies which claim either Video Games Tax Relief or VGEC. One-off costs will include familiarisation with the changes. No continuing costs are expected. This amendment is not expected to impact businesses' experience of dealing with HMRC. Amendment 3 will have a negligible administrative impact on the roughly 1,000 film and high-end television production companies which can claim special credit for VFX. There will be no impact for most claimants. HMRC estimates around 25 productions each year will be directly affected by the rules for negative amounts. One-off costs will include familiarisation with the changes and updating systems to reflect them. No continuing costs are expected. This amendment is not expected to impact businesses' experience of dealing with HMRC. The amendments are not expected to impact civil society organisations. ## Operational impact (\u00a3 million) (HMRC or other) These amendments are not expected to have any operational impacts. There will be minor guidance updates to the additional information form companies must fill out as part of making a claim to AVEC or VGEC. ## Other impacts Other impacts have been considered and none have been identified. ## Monitoring and evaluation The amendments will"}, {"file": "Creative industries and Research and Development Expenditure Credits \u2014 administrative measures - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "be monitored and assessed alongside other measures in the government's package for Research &amp; Development and creative industries tax relief changes, using data collected from company tax returns and the additional information form. ## Further advice Contact the creative industries policy team by email creativespolicy@hmrc.gov.uk for: - any questions about this change - queries about amendment 1 for RDEC All content is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0, except where otherwise stated ' Crown copyright"}, {"file": "Government fuels NHS innovation to unlock billions in growth - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "Home ## Press release ## Government fuels NHS innovation to unlock billions in growth The government updates NHS IP guidance for the first time in 23 years, cutting red tape so innovations reach patients faster and boost the UK's economic growth. From: Published Department of Health and Social Care , NHS England , Dr Zubir Ahmed MP and The Rt Hon Wes Streeting MP 18 November 2025 - Patients to access new treatments quicker as government slashes red tape and streamlines NHS intellectual property (IP) guidance for first time in 23 years - Move will support NHS becoming global leader in health systems and allow innovations to be scaled across NHS more quickly and easily - Clearer, simpler rules will unleash enormous potential of NHS innovators while unlocking billions in economic growth Patients will get access to the most advanced and groundbreaking treatments quicker, as the government slashes red tape to get new innovative products and ideas to the frontline. The government has unveiled vital updates to the Intellectual property (IP) guidance for the NHS in England - the first such update in 23 years - to turbocharge innovation, speed up patient access to new technologies and unlock economic growth. The NHS is still relying on guidance set up in 2002, which was not designed for cutting edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI). This means outdated processes have slowed down getting groundbreaking innovations to the front line, often being held up in complex local and legal negotiations. Real opportunities have been lost as a result, pushing the UK behind other health systems in translating NHS innovation into commercial success. In one case, a major collaboration between an NHS-a ffi liated researcher and a tech company - which had attracted significant interest and potential investment - was derailed after nearly 2 years of legal negotiations. In another, a company providing speech and language therapy support to 200 schools faced ongoing uncertainty for almost 2 years due to the absence of clear IP policies, hampering growth and delaying benefits to children. The new guidance addresses these challenges by streamlining processes, defining clearer roles and responsibilities, promoting consistent good practices in IP management across the NHS, and making it simpler for ideas to move from concept to commercialisation, so that innovation can reach patients faster and drive growth for the NHS and our economy. Developed in collaboration with the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), the updated guidance directly supports the government's mission to build an NHS fit for the future. As outlined in the 10 Year Health Plan, it gets the basic conditions right to promote innovation and create the conditions for local entrepreneurship, both inside and beyond the NHS, supporting grassroots innovation. Health Innovation and Safety Minister, Dr Zubir Ahmed MP, said: - For too long, innovators have faced unnecessary barriers when trying to bring life-changing ideas to patients through the NHS.

' - By getting the fundamentals right, we can drive transformation, commercialise ideas both domestically and internationally, and strengthen the UK's position as a global leader in health and life sciences research and innovation. ' - Most importantly, it will ensure that the benefits of innovation - from improved patient care and more e ffi cient services to fair commercial returns - flow directly back to patients, sta ff and the NHS, strengthening its role.' ' This new guidance ensures the NHS is fairly rewarded for the innovations it helps create - with any returns reinvested straight back into patient care and future innovation. This refreshed guidance replaces the outdated 2002 framework that has left innovators and collaborators with the NHS navigating a maze of uncertainty inconsistent IP management approaches, unclear processes and barriers that have held back great ideas across the NHS. Without reform, the UK risks missing significant opportunities to turn innovation into real impact for patients, sta ff and the wider economy. Fiona Bride, Interim Chief Commercial O ffi cer at NHS England, said: - We are pleased to have worked closely with government on this refreshed IP guidance, which brings much-needed clarity and consistency to how innovation is supported across the health service, and will help to get new treatments and technologies to patients faster. ' - The NHS has an exceptional record in bringing forward the latest innovations to patients, and this guidance will strengthen this further, giving clinicians, researchers and partners the confidence to progress ideas that improve care, and help to deliver the ambitions of the 10-Year Plan.' ' The guidance delivers on the Life Sciences Sector Plan by: - accelerating patient access to new medicines and medical technologies - enabling world-class research and development - supporting the commercialisation of ideas both domestically and internationally Professor Lucy Chappell, Chief Scientific Adviser at the Department of Health and Social Care and Chief Executive O ffi cer of the NIHR, said: - The IP guidance for the NHS marks a pivotal step in strengthening our health and care research ecosystem and will be a catalyst for progress in research and innovation. It empowers our researchers and innovators to translate ideas into impact - accelerating discovery, improving patient outcomes and reinforcing the UK's position as a global leader in health and life sciences.' ' The update is aimed at all organisations providing or commissioning NHS services across England and will provide clarity for innovators, research funders, academia and industry partners on IP ownership, collaboration and commercialisation. E ff ective IP management is central to unlocking the full value of innovations needed to drive healthcare reform and deliver the government's 10 Year Health Plan and Life Sciences Sector Plan to build an NHS fit for the future.

' - Innovation is central to delivering on the ambitions set out in the 10 Year Health Plan and Life Sciences Sector Plan, but to meet the needs of patients, health systems and the requirement of economic growth, we must better enable the implementation and spread of innovation.

Where we have identified any third party copyright information you will need to obtain permission from the copyright holders concerned. This publication is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-duty-rateschange/alcohol-duty-uprating ## Who is likely to be affected Individuals and businesses involved in the manufacture, distribution, holding, sale, importation and consumption of alcoholic products. ## General description of the measure As announced at Budget 2025, the government will uprate all alcohol duty rates in line with the Retail Price Index (RPI) at 3.66%. It will also increase the cash discount provided to small producers to maintain the relative value of Small Producer Relief (SPR), compared to the main rates. SPR provides lower alcohol duty rates for small producers - provided those products are below 8.5% alcohol by volume (ABV), not produced under licence, and are made on small producer premises producing below 4,500 hectolitres of pure alcohol per year. Consistent with the wider uprating, the government will also increase the simplified duty rates used for calculating excise duty on alcoholic products brought into Great Britain for personal use. All changes will have effect on and after 1 February 2026. ## Policy objective Alcohol duty will be uprated with RPI on 1 February 2026 to maintain its current real-terms value. This is consistent with the government's policy, reflected in the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast, that the duty should keep pace with overall prices. The government heard representations from stakeholders ranging from a duty cut or freeze to above inflation increases. This decision balances the important contribution of alcohol producers and the hospitality sector to our culture and economy, with the duty's role in reducing alcohol harm. To support eligible small producers of alcoholic products, the government will also increase the cash discount provided to small producers, maintaining the relative value of SPR compared to the main duty rates. ## Background to the measure The decision made in relation to alcohol duty at this Budget is in line with existing government policy, as reflected in the OBR forecast. ## Detailed proposal ## Operative date The new alcohol duty rates, draught rates and SPR discounts will take effect on 1 February 2026. ## Current law The main provisions relating to the production of alcoholic products and the charging, calculation and remission of alcohol duty (including any reliefs) are set out in Part 2 of the Finance (No.2) Act 2023 (https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/30/contents)."}, {"file": "Alcohol Duty uprating - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "The alcohol duty rates are contained in Schedule 7 (rates of Alcohol Duty), reduced rates for draught relief are contained in Schedule 8 (qualifying draught products - reduced rates) and tables used to calculate Small Producer Relief discounts are in Schedule 9 (small producer alcoholic products - duty discount). ## Proposed revisions Schedule 7 is amended so that the revised rates are: - duty on all alcoholic products less than 3.5% ABV - \u00a39.96 per litre of alcohol in the product - duty on still cider at least 3.5% but less than 8.5% ABV - \u00a310.39 per litre of alcohol in the product - duty on sparkling cider at least 3.5% but not exceeding 5.5% ABV - \u00a310.39 per litre of alcohol in the product - duty on beer at least 3.5% but less than 8.5% ABV - \u00a322.58 per litre of alcohol in the product - duty on spirits, wine and other fermented products at least 3.5% but less than 8.5% ABV - \u00a326.61 per litre of alcohol in the product - duty on sparkling cider exceeding 5.5% ABV but less than 8.5% ABV \u00a326.61 per litre of alcohol in the product - duty on all alcoholic products at least 8.5% but not exceeding 22% ABV \u00a330.62 per litre of alcohol in the product - duty on all alcoholic products exceeding 22% ABV - \u00a333.99 per litre of alcohol in the product Schedule 8 is amended so that the revised rates for products qualifying for draught relief are: - the reduced rate of duty on all draught alcoholic products less than 3.5% ABV - \u00a38.58 per litre of alcohol in the product - the reduced rate of duty on draught still cider at least 3.5% but less than 8.5% ABV - \u00a38.95 per litre of alcohol in the product - the reduced rate of duty on draught sparkling cider at least 3.5% but not exceeding 5.5% ABV - \u00a38.95 per litre of alcohol on product - the reduced rate of duty on draught beer, spirits, wine and other fermented products at least 3.5% (but less than 8.5%) - \u00a319.45 per litre of alcohol in the product - the reduced rate of duty on sparkling cider exceeding 5.5% but less than 8.5% ABV - \u00a319.45 per litre of alcohol in the product The marginal discount and cumulative discount figures in the tables at Schedule 9 are amended, to maintain the Small Producer Relief percentage discounts. ## Summary of impacts ## Exchequer impact (\u00a3 million) | 2025 to 2026 | 2026 to 2027 | 2027 to 2028 | 2028 to 2029 | 2029 to 2030 | 2030 to 2031 | |----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------| | nil | nil | nil | nil | nil | nil | This measure is not expected to have an Exchequer impact. ## Macroeconomic impact This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts. ## Impact on individuals, households and families Uprating alcohol duty will have an indirect impact on individuals who consume alcoholic products if the"}, {"file": "Alcohol Duty uprating - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "changes on duty rates are passed on to individuals through changes in prices for relevant products. The uprating ensures that the value of alcohol duty is maintained in real-terms. The OBR takes account of the impacts of uprating on underlying alcohol demand as part of the alcohol duty forecast and has published the price elasticities it uses in the forecast (https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/Alcohol-ElasticitiesSupplementary-Release.pdf). These measures are not expected to impact on family formation, stability or breakdown. Customer experience of engaging and interacting with HMRC is expected to remain the same, as there will be no changes in the way duty is collected. ## Equalities impacts An individual may be affected by this measure regardless of their protected characteristics. This measure is expected to impact on individuals who consume or purchase alcohol, as it will maintain the tax level on alcoholic products in real terms. If a protected group is overrepresented in this population, then it will be disproportionately impacted. Individuals who consume more than 14 units of alcohol a week are considered to be at an increasing or higher risk of alcoholrelated harm. Men are estimated to be overrepresented in the population who consume alcohol at least once a week (56%), as well the population who consume more than 14 units of alcohol a week (66%), compared to their prevalence in the UK adult population (50%). Older individuals (aged 55 and above) are also estimated to be overrepresented in the population of individuals who consume alcohol at least once a week (45%) compared to their prevalence in the UK adult population (39%). In addition, those aged 45 - 74 are estimated to be overrepresented in the population who consume more than 14 units of alcohol a week (52%) compared to in the UK adult population (44%). HMRC does not currently hold any recent data on the other protected characteristics of consumers of alcohol and so cannot make an assessment of the impacts on those with shared protected characteristics. ## Administrative impact on business including civil society organisations The changes in alcohol duty rates will impact on alcoholic product manufacturers, importers and retailers. The measure is expected to have a negligible administrative impact on up to 8,000 businesses that either produce alcoholic products in the UK, import alcoholic products into the UK, or are involved in warehousing alcoholic products in duty suspense. Those businesses affected by the duty rate change will incur a negligible one-off cost of familiarisation with the new duty rates. There are not expected to be any continuing costs. This measure is not expected to have any impact on civil society organisations. Customer experience is expected to remain broadly the same as this measure does not alter how businesses interact with HMRC. This measure is expected to have some impact on the hospitality industry, assuming that alcohol producers increase wholesale prices to reflect the uprating. This measure will impact on some small and micro businesses affected by the alcohol duty uprating. However, the impact will be reduced for producers eligible"}, {"file": "Alcohol Duty uprating - GOV.UK.txt", "source": "Budget 2025", "status": "pre_legislation", "chunk": "for SPR and will be further mitigated by the increase in the cash discount. ## Operational impact (\u00a3 million) (HMRC or other) HMRC will need to make changes to IT systems to implement the measure. A review of the changes and respective costs are ongoing. ## Other impacts Increasing alcohol duty rates on all alcoholic products by RPI may lead to a minor decrease in overall alcohol consumption in the UK which can contribute towards tackling alcohol related harm. Any reduction in alcohol consumption from this measure may also be associated to reductions in alcohol-related economic inactivity. Other impacts have been considered and none have been identified. ## Monitoring and evaluation This measure will be monitored through information collected from tax receipts. ## Further advice If you have any questions about this change, email alcohol policy mailbox.alcoholpolicy@hmrc.gov.uk.
